Hello Michael,

 

It has come to our attention that you are currently subscribed to TrainingPeaks Premium on two platforms. This can happen when you sign up through both your mobile app store and our website, resulting in your account being billed twice. 

To avoid continuing to be billed for both subscriptions, you need to cancel your mobile subscription (http://links.transactional.trainingpeaks.com/u/click?_t=ba0080d9c74e4930ac3dc26c70364091&_m=45017f0d91c24fc6b5b8777c707c04b5&_e=03Raj7hSJPCrx_pNpC_S_bfGU5pa9mGOkume9na89V8nq08TVx6Q767tKJlcbmcoh0MTwXdZPzGh6Nk9n7M41Edvyj_JI1pf6uDFRd7-_JpgOsC6hI88iFyw47Ecr6C6J_7U5gvNt91JrG8mYCjxs7vL2h0DXETpMhHFXBBmHWDrhnq4_qadCCmnccUBKinwyS0CL2ndP-5zm1iXDbZ3YQq3dM8tvNJKax-fgCQE9KKFlACq5ObydNngnvhX9kdXnC5oK6pRN6c19nFKlaL9Tkap3E4-DPOQWBcSVJTZJA17ebF11EQXhxohaZVflHjYIGzTSpijhY5ZSzoY5OODChJ02vPW2zaAcSCuMSlYzpjlxpxY4PTvDc7n5JoQ4XVCfG3XfUu1ttBdyWd6k43NhxiSZkBx0odzXCOzfiwrtyg%3D) .

Choosing a Plan,"Hello,
I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out for advice on choosing a training plan as well as supplementing it with additional training. First, I am training for a full Ironman around November 2025. This will be my first ever Ironman (I have never completed a 70.3 or a marathon). My athletic background is that of a competitive swimmer (collegiate level). I am currently in the military, so running and rucking are common tasks for me but the running is usually limited to ~5 miles at a 8:00/mi pace. For this reason, I was thinking the beginner plan (36 week) would be best for me, but would that be too easy? The one caveat to choosing a plan is that my job in the military requires I maintain and train in the gym for strength and power as well. Do you have an idea of how to supplement lifting with the ironman training so as to not take too much of a toll on the body?"
Re: Important Information about your TrainingPeaks Subscription,"Hi team,


thank your for your mail. While I do not know, how I managed to order twice, I am glad that you let me know. I followed the suggestion and canceled the apple subscription. Up to now, I still see both entries in the subscription overview. Let me know, if the matter is sorted. 


Your help is appreciated. Best

Programme Refund,"Hi there.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a refund for the training programme that I purchased today (09/10/2024).
Due to unforeseen personal circumstances, I will unfortunately be unable to complete the programme/use it for the weeks to come. I am asking please that you process my refund of $74USD to the original payment method used. Please let me know if you require any further information.

I am a current user of Training Peaks and look forward to returning when I am able to. However, for now, this assistance would be greatly appreciated. I purchased the programme only today so I hope that this request is prompt enough. Thank you very much in advance. 

Sincerely,  
Mikeely Jones

A couple days ago I connected my Garmin Connect account to my new TrainingPeaks account. I can see my most recent health data on TrainingPeaks, but my activity history from Garmin Connect is not appearing.

I have tried disconnecting and reconnecting my Garmin Connect account twice and also checked the privacy settings on Connect, but this has not resolved the issue.

Could you please help me troubleshoot this problem?

Thanks,
Simon

Threshold pace,"Hi, one of my athletes (Steve Dickens) recently completed a 5k TT and I used the time/distance calculator in his zone settings to establish that his threshold pace is 8:38 min/mile pace. However when I tried to create a session at 100% threshold it keeps putting the pace in the session as 7:59 min/mile pace? Surely at 100% it should be 8:38? Please can you help, regards Charlotte"

ATP adjustments,"Hi,
I'm doing strength training with a coach and cycling on my own.
I'm planning to create an ATP for cycling, however I cannot know the periodization of my strength training, this differs during the year based on the actual program.
If I create an ATP and also add my strength training (I can add calories burnt and HR after the session) - which I can only do after each session - does that adjust my cycling plan?
Or do I have to scale down my ATP for the weeks where my strength training gets too tough manually?
Thanks.
Angela"

How adaptable can a training plan be made?,"Hi

I have just signed up for the Busselton ironman in December 2025, I have completed 2  70.3’s  and want to step up to the full next year. I completed the half in 5 and a half hours.

What I am wanting to know is if a training plan can be adapted as I work a fly in fly out job, I fly to work and back alternative Thursdays,(1 Week at work and then one week off) so I wouldn’t be able to train at all on Thursdays, and I work 13 Hour days for the week I am at work, so I will only have about an hour each day that I could exercise while I’m at work, and I don’t have access to a swimming while at work either.

Would a plan be able to get adapted to these limitations?

 While I’m at home for my week off I would be able to do longer efforts throughout the week.

Obviously I have a long time to go before next year's race, so I feel I should have plenty of time to try get my endurance sorted.

Thanks for your help

TrainingPeaks iOS App,"Hello, my trainer says he cannot see my notes . Can you help ?"
New Strength Hover Over and Size ,"Most workout ""blocks"" have a brief summary and then if you want more detail you click on it. The new strength is 1st of all a bigger block (nearly 3 times the size of a ""normal"" block""), and when you hover over it gives you a large preview on the screen (vs having to click). I find both of these behaviors incredibly distracting and not an improvement over the current blocks. Plus the inconsistent behavior between blocks is just really frustrating. Could you please make the new strength blocks the same size as the other workout blocks and get rid  of the hover over preview and have the blocks behave the same? So just a short summary on the block, if you want details click on it for more information. I think consistency is both size and behavior is important.  The size thing especially, most days are going to have multiple workouts and by making the strength workouts bigger than default size, now athletes have to scroll down further to see other workouts on a day. At the normal size you can generally see your full days across a week without having to scroll down. The big strength blocks just take up so much more real estate. Screen shot included to illustrate. Look at Mon and Wed vs Tues in terms of how much real estate the top level takes up. "

Hello Manuel,

 

It has come to our attention that you are currently subscribed to TrainingPeaks Premium on two platforms. This can happen when you sign up through both your mobile app store and our website, resulting in your account being billed twice. 

To avoid continuing to be billed for both subscriptions, you need to cancel your mobile subscription (http://links.transactional.trainingpeaks.com/u/click?_t=ba0080d9c74e4930ac3dc26c70364091&_m=c86179aee2964636bef701a2a3342b05&_e=ChhHvWAPYxIykdUn6K-wK7Qw3rrAVTdfk0AURwWTDdwzv18p0lRLsnPwRUZYLKK_JuDa3-FyPOnIWSGtoLD9RPLdzhriutY9f0cjQfgRiKXlfTOSmI7Rk-psQgUND0MxF3j4YA7l1cQsZziSoem6BTIVqEt9hf3K-XEtRAcxcOYdVpiEEdGcFj1J_dZBrspBRsASOq1k-E3uMyRbyEydWLAKoWE5xIiycA15Ee28RoYe8rKmcnf2_RowPh95lsmgYh0nlmWrkgLmvl1x7__kJfkXG4nqCQwLcG81fvbCPgNTecmvp9LB3ZM7jQGL3YWXSdXjbUhl8doZwXZt5zIXJMRsEY9m5AZGd74aY2kGH5VvsYguqVXnFy_NIGpdVYa180wtVa9cq-dBcPujbJ99rzVB7325d4Z9c-9X0BCtAdw%3D) . This will not affect your TrainingPeaks account or any of your training data. 

 

Your account has been credited with additional time for the period you were double-subscribed. That means you won’t need to pay again until the amount you have paid matches the time you have been subscribed. Visit your subscription management page (http://links.transactional.trainingpeaks.com/u/click?_t=ba0080d9c74e4930ac3dc26c70364091&_m=c86179aee2964636bef701a2a3342b05&_e=ChhHvWAPYxIykdUn6K-wK-ZnG8Xq_auV_LBIZyCtXkA5OHlvIdWdzXfCB0Nr4ZKgBvGY_PynP_tKZMLSInTLFRkL6chHptq5_WDrS6UhPIhfc7UGKpIsUPrhGliL-BbbzmtVRGTfyAD3Y10dNzXnhw-p_u3moZgFTP-lIpvG7_5u5ITJp4yQzdsSk1pXMNdJabxHYyXd0Bh8xtxhhID2RftJAT9uFSg2sIDI5XfIjNaTNLWuL_7aydy9upEiWmbnYo7G29m2uPAD9RJ2we_80HLFqTvZdDbA3zTIwZmmjdRUIoQo_VCHruxoivVZnPXPYpgdflUtETm7BrRWfOymtA%3D%3D) to find out when your next payment will occur.

Enable dormant coach account,"Hello. I have a very old coaching account that I'm hoping I can re-enable in order to salvage a workout library. I am coaching again after taking over 12 years off. If this possible? Alternatively, when I closed my coaching account many years ago, I shared the entirety of my coaching workout library with my personal TP athlete account. Is it possible to share the workout library from my athlete account to a new coaching account? I have over 1000 workouts in my library and I would really like to re-enable them in an active coaching account. Thank you. "

Can’t log in,"I have had TrainingPeaks with a coach for over a year now. About 2 weeks ago I got logged out and it comes up to log in, I have the correct username and password but it says “payment required” and won’t let me log in. I have TrainingPeaks free and have never paid for it so I’m not sure what this is about. Some times when I open the app it says account expired and renew it on the website but I can’t do this. My coach and my brother can’t get in either. "
structured workouts for icehockey etc,"I currently have Garmin FR55 and its fine.
I mostly do running and I want to use TrainingPeaks to reach my sub40 10k goal.
However. I play icehockey and floorball twice a week and I know it oftes lands in at around 100 and 120 TSS for those sessions since I have ""cardio"" data on past workouts.
What I want to be able to do is create structured workouts in TP with a wide hr% range but with a TSS of 100 and 120. I can do that and I ahve tried both ""custom"" and ""other"" and several other types.
These get synced to my garmin connect app without any issues but they do not show up on my FR55. For running and cycling structured workouts it shows up.
It is not a dealbreaker but I am missing around 200TSS/week when I try to make my trainingschedule and it somewhat defeats the purpose of using TP.

Any suggestions as how to be able to plan the amount of TSS and have it automatically corrected when a session is done? Is the problem with the watch? Is there a list of what TP workout types that are supported in what devices?

Data Sync from Garmin Connect,"Good morning! I recently joined a triathlon coach who urged me to get on training peaks. Two days ago I signed up and set up my account. I connected TP with Garmin Connect and checked the box for syncing historical data up to five years back so that TP has my athlete profile and workout history. I read your FAQs on syncing with Garmin Connect and ensured I did not terminate my connection with Garmin during the 24 hours it may take to sync.

Unfortunately, none of my workouts synced with my TP account. My new workouts have synced since joining but none of the old ones. I did request my data from Garmin to be able to move them over manually, but doing so one at a time seems like an inefficient way to move data with such robust software. 

Can you help me connect my historical data to TP and get everything running smoothly? 

I look forward to returning to training and learning how to get the most out of trainingpeaks.

Best,
Jacob"

But the longer his reign of dominance has extended, the more apparent it has become that Geb’s success has as much to do with his mental attitude as with whatever genetic advantages he may have.

When I click Edit from the three-dot vertical bar on a Metrics box on the calendar, all the metrics are rendered in a bigger box but there's no way to actually edit or add any metrics. The fields are rendered as read-only and can't be changed, and there's no field for Weight even though that is one the fields that are on the In Use list in Settings. How can I add things like body weight using the new Metrics panel?

The icons are there but they are not active, I can try to click on them but nothing happens. There is no slider for the rpe scale. Just thought you should know that. I'm starting to use it with my athletes and will let you know their feedback. The database is huge but does not include machines, which is unfortunate or even just a simple KB swing where you only go to your eye height, not overhead american style.

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Melyssa,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">It looks like this code might have been applied to your subscription when you were testing out the trial period which you then cancelled before it chaged you. Our billing system is now thinking that you have already used the code and therefor will not let you apply it again. I apologize for this inconvenience.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Here is a new code for you to use which is also worth 20% off a subscription: TPSupport202</p>

<p dir=""auto"">This coupon code is the only one we have to offer and is only good for one-time use. At renewal, you will need to get a new code from another source (NGB, coach, promotion) to apply to your account to continue receiving a discount. You can select your subscription terms and purchase here:</p>

Training peaks coaching qualification ,"Hi there 
I am currently an Ironman Certified Coach and I’ve been qualified since 2016 through the Ironman University. I’ve been coaching athletes on this platform since 2016 very successfully building a small business through referrals and recommendation. My athletes achieve their goals. 

In addition to this I have a Masters in Performance Sports Coaching from the University of Stirling in 2021.  I studied under Dr Andrew Kirkland, a regular author published by training peaks. I’m also a level 4 personal trainer qualifying in 2016. 

Ironman has created links with an AI training platform and whilst many people have moved onto the platform I prefer Training Peaks. I received an email today and thought it might be time to switch my qualification to Training Peaks. Is this possible? What do I need to do to gain the qualifications to coach as a TP qualified coach please? 

Could you let me know the cost and if this is possible? 

Many thanks

Hi 

 

Hope your ok 

 

I’ve just tried to use the membership discount on training peaks for a trialing programme and it’s saying it’s invalid and can’t be used 

 

The code I’ve used was 24BritishTri 

 

Your help would be appreciated 

 

Kind regards

Hi support team! My coach left me a message with d...,"Hi support team! My coach left me a message with description of my workout. The workout contains of 4km warmup, running drills A,C (like high knees, butt kicks or lunges etc) uphill and downhill repetitions and a 2km cooldown. I want to build this workour in TP now. For uphill/downhill runnning I can use 2 steps repeats with RPE as a units (since I have to go easy downhill but 8-9 RPE uphill) but the TP workout wouldn’t know that there is planned elevation differance. In addition the running drills, although may be specified also as 2 steps repeats, would be difficult to add with RPE, tempo or heart rate range. What's the optimal way to add such drills to the workout in TP which can help estimate planned TSS? I'm asking about it because drill will be significant work, however the distance covered during such repetition would be rather short. 
Thanks in advance!

Question. I am going to coach an athlete who has a premium account until Feb 2025.

Or should I invite him instead of creating a new account?

I am unsure what would be the option to do.

Best regards

Now, on each new day, objective, quantifiable metrics are imported, albeit with metrics from the Garmin Forerunner and my Garmin Weight Scales displayed in two different windows.

NGO account,"Dear ladies and gentlemen,

 

 

I’m the sports scientist of the Austrian sailing federation.

 

We would like to use trainingspeaks as our future platform to organise the planning of physical training for our athletes.

 

I saw on the homepage that you have an offer for national governing bodies, like as we are as the Austrian sailing federation.

How can this work or is it possible to get the discount, please?

 

We are planning to use two Coaches Accounts (unlimited) as we like to have an account for the Olympic Team and another

for the youth/development team.

 

And two other questions:

 

* Would it be possible to pay one year in advance or is it just on a monthly basis
* And is it possible to create own exercises including videos in the library?

 

Thank you very much and I hope you can help me!

 

All the best

Jürgen

New format,"I have been away from Training Peaks for awhile. Today I restarted and found that the calendar has changed (and not for the better). I now have ""2 metrics"" on the calendar - want one - but want the information of the two. Before, I could add information from 1 metric to the other metric.
The current setup does not allow me to edit information and it does not allow me to keep information anywhere on the system that I could previously. Perhaps it is there, but I do not have the interest in looking for it. It was just fine the way the system worked before.
Basically, no editing - no use.

Training plan focussed on XC racing with sparely XCM races,"Dear sir/madam,

I value the articles of Trainingpeaks and reaching out looking for what you would advise as trainingplan for my situation.

I started racing 2023 and this year I took it more seriously. I have participated in the 3 Nations Cup (XC racing NL, BE and DE), and did the Nations Cup of XC racing in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, I did suffer an injury this year, which blocked some good training progression. My season has ended now, and I will take some weeks of rest now, to fully recover. For information, I have FTP ±320 Watts, 71 kg of weight.

During this season, I found that I was lacking in the things listed below:
- repeated hard efforts. I have good 30s power, but do lack repeated hard efforts.
- Longer hill climbs. I found during racing that I do suffer a lot when having longer hill clims. Like climbs duration of 1 - 3 min
- During XCM, I found out that I couldn't overcome a 'hard start'. So at the first couple of climbs, I did suffer too much, which dropped me off and costs me a lot of time.

After the resting period, I am looking into my trainingsplan from then on. I will catch up training likely halfway November. Currently, I have in mind a solid 6 weeks of z2 riding, maybe with some Sweetspot trainings some now and then. As well, I would like to add one gym session per week for strenght. End of december, beginning January I will be in Spain where I can do a solid trainingweek, so I wanted to start more specific trainings from that moment. End of March I have to be in race shape.

With this information, what would you advice as trainingsplan? I have looked into some trainingsplan, but I am not sure what fits best for my situation. I am really curious about trainings, nutrition and so on.

I am really looking forward hearing from you,

Best regards,

Hello Manu,

 

It has come to our attention that you are currently subscribed to TrainingPeaks Premium on two platforms. This can happen when you sign up through both your mobile app store and our website, resulting in your account being billed twice. 

To avoid continuing to be billed for both subscriptions, you need to cancel your mobile subscription (http://links.transactional.trainingpeaks.com/u/click?_t=ba0080d9c74e4930ac3dc26c70364091&_m=df570902f6b74fa8b902223e0f2f8e84&_e=nhWnu6w7cbPsGd3DalIOzye3crZ8jsQFP7J54Ww5VVcU354ZDcAdUoX1yV6V28c1xWGqxWVHsm1J8PSiZ70sEKz-qfKtxoeNt9l6Fn86tfSuUwssDKj9JukURirM2le8Qt1Cp7zb093aBFHdb9Fcw3688toCkuScw07PEXK3Vbdqooz59X39aGKD91wWuXi2zSG7w1lUeMB_EdYnJWzqxE-MbmVcQNSzTcsKld1GOO0oY8PP5xnkZOOiakciZvVV6K-CZUzWsF4hx1Pe0StRyMD2wK3LQ-g85Rse5A5Xm3aFGl_2NTHp2sK4OKg_8aO7oO-WDYeShtlft6EPNLq3lBcXuKDCkFHt-lVEjkThnVRsZRheF1SffOlHxl0LstPj9b9_HIlxVwXPf_q_ubIG2A%3D%3D) . This will not affect your TrainingPeaks account or any of your training data. 

 

Your account has been credited with additional time for the period you were double-subscribed. That means you won’t need to pay again until the amount you have paid matches the time you have been subscribed. Visit your subscription management page (http://links.transactional.trainingpeaks.com/u/click?_t=ba0080d9c74e4930ac3dc26c70364091&_m=df570902f6b74fa8b902223e0f2f8e84&_e=nhWnu6w7cbPsGd3DalIOzz2WOA7bEW3Ob3xQi-qfjHG6dCaryzafN0BGBy2CDXDLB8IjAH1owhf-M59jPoXgvm71loTZDexrjhbtRAfRGlC5q4lFDfPmTkud26gNRqizIsbOrcyn2iPpc1R1XxwljOBuzL1jxT4aZ5z0ktFFOZ3P_Fm6M0eEOyMzmwOLar8ZCac0Y3T78h9U3qoagnQ6oKhNPEMD2jHQCuQgcuvS5xJeQo_t91Z_n3WhCNqjB1VU6Wwz6f9C0laMf1oxKqWg_LzuqladwBOWBE-8mUT-pVElGS9zsJmhv4xW73ta1ERP) to find out when your next payment will occur.

Inquiry prior to purchase of Training Peaks IronMan 36 Week Plan,"Hello,

I hope you are doing well. I am interested in training for my first full ironman and came across ""Phil's Intermediate Full Distance Triathlon + Free Email Access to Coach: 36 Weeks"" through Training Peaks.

Prior to purchase, I had a few questions that I would appreciate somebody on your team's response as soon as possible - 

1. With the $129 plan listed above 
(https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/triathlon/ironman/tp-130235/%E2%80%9Cmailto:info@myprocoach.net%E2%80%9D), does the software/system allow me to move workouts around within the week? For example, if I can't swim on a Monday and want to put it for Wednesdays?

2. How rigid is the scheduling of the software? If I purchase a 36 week plan, but end up training for a triathlon 40 weeks away for instance, am I able to duplicate and repeat weeks without the calendar system moving forward to the subsequent training week?

3. If I purchase the plan, do I have access to this one training plan and its workouts forever? That would be frustrating if I make such a costly purchase and only retain access for exactly 36 weeks, especially in the case that my training isn't starting immediately and I'd like to get used to the platform first.

4. Can I go back to old workouts and repeat them?

5. Zwift is able to adjust my FTP etc based on recent data - are the workouts in Training Peaks dynamic in the same way? How does the system know that I am improving, and should perhaps increase the pace of a run between this week and next week in a way that is faster/a bigger jump than the system originally anticipated?

6. Is there a free trial I can use for a few weeks to see if I like the calendar and integration system?


I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of my inquiry at your convenience.

Re: Thank you for your TrainingPeaks payment,"Hello,
I thought training peaks wasn‘t going to renew cause I had marked „Auto – Renew Off“.

Today I was charged for an training peaks premium account, that I will not be using for at least another year due to pregnancy and pregnancy complications.

Could you please refund this to my credit card?

Apply USAT Membership 20% Discount,"Hi TrainingPeaks team. I recently became a member of USA Triathlon, and would like to apply their 20% discount to my annual plan.

Thank you for the help!"

Missing activities,"Dear Team,
I have a very weird situation in my training peak application I've lost all my data from the past year. I would like to ask you two questions:
- do you by any chance have any information how it was deleted? I had a coach with who I've stoped my journey the moment I finished my main goal and I'm hoping that it was not him who deleted data but I want to verify that with you.
- is it possible to somehow recover that information it was more then a year of trainings that I have recorded and for me it is a priceless data.

Appreciate your help,
Michal Borucinski"

To avoid continuing to be billed for both subscriptions, you need to cancel your mobile subscription (http://links.transactional.trainingpeaks.com/u/click?_t=ba0080d9c74e4930ac3dc26c70364091&_m=a3bde6b9d0a94451b5864eafcda86fb3&_e=vfEwb8ZvifdZkVvgVIpwjuxUErpoSfvT68BEKwLysqR9E6pqQDDzNtdyVzAxylAoab78gMOESdqSdLjyJjHea65BrYNk60rCS6ViOQguhb0_oXh7f7BNe8F-qo46ks97d_JtxknFaqIYdL0qNi4hPY2YDEGT8PVcS6UiPMsAyBrxw5qTGyY74rS6dHqrnzXzFK4nro41iY6YVXWa4jNs6vjslIQamppBk9CGNBwNPexcvHA0di-qHTtOKgZIQhFEZO0FbhxqbKX3DY7WKGKuYOcxqdevFwKEYS5ogfyv_4rPf8JcVAE4aJgbe_oWvcqs0NftB_Lyb1Zyzh9WLZaESIabamMkTeg0EMfPBVu63kD3K2e3Wfeo_uDtKjhDmdNNibq9eN1xsYIqow5VWcU0yA%3D%3D) .

Screen shot included. Monday shows ""new"" strength, Tuesday old strength where I can re order them."

Training peaks premium comes with my coaching plan, see https://evokeendurance.com/compare-training-options/ .  I recently received an email from trainingpeaks.com about a subscription renewal.  My questions are:

- Is it at all possible to receive a partial refund for my previous purchase of training peaks premium, because after just a few months I started coaching with Evoke endurance?

- I would like to cancel my next direct payment for training peaks premium, BUT still utilize the features of training peaks premium, because it is included in the coaching fees I pay to Evoke endurance.  How can I do this?  I will also contact Kylee

I got a popup saying my account is valid for a 14 day trial (see attached screenshot). I clicked on it and it took me to a checkout page where it explicitly said I will be charged on 27th of October.

Thanks for your help in advance.

<p dir=""auto"">Feb 6, 2024, 9:41 AM MST</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thanks. I love your platform...and probably with this project going to make some folks shake their head......but....difficult to stop technology progress. either adapt or be consumed.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Figuring out a bunch of things...but the capability is actually pretty authenticate....now to see if it converts into real human performance capability.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I've done a number of triathlons including full and mountain climbing as well....so I'm able to give a pretty critical skeptical eye to what it is producing.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Now that it has built a 24 week plan --- the target pace and speeds were unrealistic. Now it is also able to create suggested meal plans...and generates the detailed cooking instructions (not shown)</p>

<p dir=""auto"">1. Lemon Herb Grilled Salmon with Quinoa Salad</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Main: Salmon fillets are marinated in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and fresh herbs like dill, parsley, and thyme before grilling to perfection.
<br>Side: A refreshing quinoa salad with cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, feta, and a lemon-olive oil dressing, garnished with parsley.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">2. Chicken and Veggie Stir-Fry</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Main: Sliced chicken breast is stir-fried with sesame oil and mixed with colorful vegetables such as bell peppers, broccoli, snap peas, and carrots, all tossed in a savory soy-ginger-honey sauce.
<br>Side: Accompanied by fragrant jasmine rice, sprinkled with sesame seeds and sliced green onions.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">3. Beef and Arugula Pesto Pasta</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Main: Ground beef is browned and tossed with al dente pasta and a homemade pesto made from arugula, basil, Parmesan, pine nuts, and garlic.
<br>Combine: The dish is finished with cherry tomatoes and extra Parmesan cheese for added flavor and texture.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">4. Herb-Crusted Pork Chops with Sweet Potato Mash</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Main: Pork chops are encrusted with a mix of breadcrumbs, Parmesan, and fresh herbs, then pan-fried.
<br>Side: Served over a creamy mash of sweet potatoes, seasoned with butter, milk, salt, and pepper, and drizzled with a herb-infused olive oil.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">5. Ground Turkey Tacos with Avocado Lime Crema</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Main: Ground turkey is seasoned with a blend of chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and cooked until browned. The meat is then filled into warm corn tortillas.
<br>Side: Topped with a homemade avocado lime crema, made by blending ripe avocado, sour cream, lime juice, and cilantro, and garnished with shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">These turkey tacos offer a healthy and tasty alternative, keeping your dinners diverse and satisfying. Each meal is crafted to ensure a good balance of protein, grains, and vegetables, providing nutritious and delicious options for your weeknight dinners.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Create shopping lists that I ported over to Walmart delivery, which was delivered to my house at 8am this morning....</p>

<p dir=""auto"">To prepare the five dinners for two people, here's a detailed shopping list with the required amounts:</p>

<br>Chicken breast: 1 pound

<p dir=""auto"">It also builds playlists for the training days....</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Creating an energetic playlist featuring 80s hair band music for your W1D3 workout can boost your motivation and make your training session more enjoyable. Here's a suggested playlist to keep you energized:</p>

<p dir=""auto"">1. ""Jump"" - Van Halen</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* A classic anthem that's all about getting up and moving, perfect for starting your workout with a burst of energy.

<p dir=""auto"">* This sing-along favorite with its memorable hook is great for maintaining a steady pace during your workout.

<p dir=""auto"">* The driving beat and empowering lyrics make this an ideal song for pushing through challenging parts of your workout.
<br>5. ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" - Twisted Sister</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* An energetic and rebellious tune that can help boost your determination and resilience.
<br>6. ""You Give Love A Bad Name"" - Bon Jovi</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Another high-energy Bon Jovi hit that's perfect for keeping the momentum going.
<br>7. ""Kickstart My Heart"" - Mötley Crüe</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* With its rapid tempo and adrenaline-pumping rhythm, this song is great for high-intensity intervals.
<br>8. ""Panama"" - Van Halen</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* A song that's all about speed and energy, making it perfect for the more intense segments of your workout.
<br>9. ""Welcome To The Jungle"" - Guns N' Roses</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* The aggressive tempo and raw energy of this track can help push you to your limits.
<br>10. ""Crazy Train"" - Ozzy Osbourne</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* The iconic riff and Ozzy's powerful vocals are sure to add an extra boost to your workout's final stretch.
<br>11. ""Eye of the Tiger"" - Survivor</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Although not by a hair band, this classic fits the energetic vibe perfectly and is ideal for cooling down or wrapping up your workout with its inspiring message.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Remember to adjust the volume to a comfortable level so that you can stay focused and aware of your surroundings, especially if you're working out outdoors or in a shared space. Enjoy your energetic 80s hair band workout playlist for W1D3!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Then using FOAM swim goggles and Engo Glasses along with a Garmin Fenix solar 7 with HR monitor, I'll create a ton of data that can be analyzed....the longer term goal would be to connect all of this to a platform like yours and make the usability far more streamlined.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I mean in reality when I buy a training program right now and send am email to the coach – its a real peron, but do I really know? With the ability now to create audio and video...you package all of this up and when done right...very difficult to tell the difference between real and generated......very scary but the future.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Of course, I still have to go out and do the swim, bike, run....but can it guide me, keep me motivated and provide feedback at some level similar to a real coach? That is the question I hope to explore with this project.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I'm posting along the way as I dont think this has been attempted before, especially over a 6 month period for an event like Ironman.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">No I dont have any plans to coach anyone. I'm actually working on a project that mixes technology &amp; AI to see how it can function together and impact real world performance. Using Lake Placid Ironman as the target race. No stranger to Ironman...but am curious to see how different aspects of technology and AI can be brought into the human performance spectrum.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Attached is what I am hoping I can create without having to do it manually day by day.</p>

Hello Patrick,

 

It has come to our attention that you are currently subscribed to TrainingPeaks Premium on two platforms. This can happen when you sign up through both your mobile app store and our website, resulting in your account being billed twice. 

To avoid continuing to be billed for both subscriptions, you need to cancel your mobile subscription (http://links.transactional.trainingpeaks.com/u/click?_t=ba0080d9c74e4930ac3dc26c70364091&_m=691899bf2f6e474b9f7e26257d83ae4d&_e=b8H-R-A_nPwfO_dUz-B8HjtQNFdmMt5GJzhS_BVj17ABD2d29ijQVNhGOLT_M0uBY9T32owL6otZtOiwL0i9dzdzhNWyPD4gr4GLeAQ9FWBC4VWdx8nadMchBaQYmjzTIT4D0MSqVbZVxD_EP_jbimQ8j0mTHT4z5BYvNLW7-Srd205IUokCFfibrmiH_X1LfBw8NrU4z4dHs3EWEbIvRD4iguywIkRN3NLNijs8qHljnqlAV2btqIb1yQ3ZY7DzQ27ia8XhIoEdUZZQTl2nZ-F9nDPfdX9JT7bTJuQEFSO-qQKQ4jeXOWjfOJdjRjF4wMIwspEr-1i8nldKctEFtxLc3oMV8ZaP5bJcU5IjdHHaIwNNJSgVQCDJ979rWxBtg-S0mnfi29dZctfobq37rg%3D%3D) . This will not affect your TrainingPeaks account or any of your training data. 

 

Your account has been credited with additional time for the period you were double-subscribed. That means you won’t need to pay again until the amount you have paid matches the time you have been subscribed. Visit your subscription management page (http://links.transactional.trainingpeaks.com/u/click?_t=ba0080d9c74e4930ac3dc26c70364091&_m=691899bf2f6e474b9f7e26257d83ae4d&_e=b8H-R-A_nPwfO_dUz-B8HgHYzAIaeeh4NRViUQN1gwsg0JKChhBGXN27B9S17Z5bYkbuQA-s69FpdrDqsp_e6pPTO7gt1iFKnFN_qLKCdLjZWgNGJK5o8q64g5t3QJqg3h2gYYV-kij2OXYh6e_Cyda6goHQZIH-pGZOFKdqKs05299RqovCbXroLfaKgLAzSguHeovcvNKWFaA0R6n0P_R9wpWI4IyTWLAC_zvjQywCU5a5cA3P3cZ4aj6LOouXVIpycaFGARhInXTgz56DKjcoDGk0sXV3LCv9H61okEUa3sz7mDKVKLlAaTKD6w8D) to find out when your next payment will occur.

 

We hope you continue to enjoy your TrainingPeaks subscription!

<p dir=""auto"">Thank you for your support in the transition process!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I am wondering if there is any way that I might be able to gain a period of time (e.g. 1 hr or day) to access to my old Training Peaks account or share my workout libraries to Jake's account? In looking at Jake's new TP account together, we noticed that the libraries that I had built out to support individual athlete programming are no longer available with the start of Jake's new account.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">If this is not possible, I completely understand and Jake I will look to build these out these libraries together on his new account.</p>

TrainingPeaks iOS App,Hello
Coaching-Account,"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

 

diese Woche habe ich nun meine A-Lizenz des BDR erhalten. Dort wurde nochmals auf die Kooperation mit Trainingspeaks aufmerksam gemacht.

Daher wollte ich mich nun erkundigen, welche Rabatte es auf welche Abonnements es gibt?

Aktuell habe ich nur wenige Sportler, welche ich (ehrenamtlich) betreue, weshalb ich zum aktuellen Stand nicht das beworbene Unlimited-Paket benötigen würde.

 

Ich freue mich von Ihnen zu hören!

Die Nachweise finden Sie im Anhang.

 

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Sven Schreiber"

Hello Alan,



It has come to our attention that you are currently subscribed to TrainingPeaks Premium on two platforms. This can happen when you sign up through both your mobile app store and our website, resulting in your account being billed twice.


To avoid continuing to be billed for both subscriptions, you need to cancel your mobile subscription<http://links.transactional.trainingpeaks.com/u/click?_t=ba0080d9c74e4930ac3dc26c70364091&_m=d472c56a42cf4691b91ada62f77fd6cc&_e=Mx83kvR7ylxb2qSQSD3TYmfjeLyhFsrVLCRldI2q0tCKgmT0Pco9uWyvZJF1a0VIARO3ApQq7MUugaY-OthmiRcAUFcUxrIkTqmkbMGRCf1zvpHoMyEZ6XTspw2YJj4hbjidKpNNS907sO7wbTv-7vuB8E-rPMSwHs9rMo8GP4FXPcDvcK5HaL_0wLCRHSeao0y08TeC8UA9qK-nkwWzryoJ6Jgg7iZfg8tyMoOv_wFpdQIwGKvWmCuCRjUJymxqWbh34QBmxKzyHqvW3GhocgzEQZX766zq0as8IUIcPnzXMfDxdpUSyYcjk_d69hgpBQTH99msftt2wQYl9Qd5LrzxsuGtsFfG3nqf1bMfZBeHd_a32nxVmvMxxuE55qNx9W0FLbJn3SNqpE7ghtfCQqVlWkd3Sius9r-Ow68nr4k%3D>.

I like the goal option and would like to set to repeat daily for 90 days (or as long as possible). Things I would put into my daily goal list would be things like Take Supplements, Take Creatine, Meditate, Stretch. If possible, I would make a new reoccuring goal for Friday and add in, charge everything for the weekend, check bikes.  Right now I have  supplements as a workout - and to confirm that I take it them I tried to put in 1 min of workout. Not ideal and not doing. Prefer the easy check box I find that I use this app for all my calendar items, not my google calendar anymore. Becoming my default.

Hopeful refund,"Dear TrainingPeaks Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently purchased a recommended training plan through the TrainingPeaks app via the training plan quiz (Mountain marathon 50k with Doug Stewart) but after reviewing it in detail, I realised that it is far too advanced for my current fitness level. I am concerned that attempting to follow the plan could put me at risk of injury, given my present physical condition.

For these reasons, I would like to request a refund for the purchase if possible? While I appreciate the quality, structure & property protection of the plan, it’s not the right fit for me at this time, and I believe it would be unwise to proceed with it.

Please let me know if you need any further information from me to process this request. I appreciate your understanding and look forward to your response.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,

Compare TSS between athletes,"I have a group and wanted to compare TSS and speed (duration of training) between athletes for the same type of training. So they all perform the same training, at the same time. But after the training I wanted to compare the TSS. Is it possible to get this in a chart?"
TrainingPeaks iOS App,"Hi, I accidentally purchased premium. Please could I have a refund and my account be reverted to the standard account?"
Training peaks will not accept discount code,"Dear Training Peaks,

 

Can you please post a support telephone number on your website so members can contact you and get a response in a timely manner, as opposed to creating these bullshit tickets that nobody in Training peaks reads for a few days.

I have a webpage open and trying to pay my subscription right now. I am not going to keep this page open forever.

Training peaks will not accept the up to date discount code from Cycling Ireland. 24CYCLINGIRELAND.

Please advise.

I cannot wait for a response to a ticket. It’s important to treat members with respect. That’s an insult to paying members to ask them to wait for so long to a payment query.

 

Regards,

Eamon

Hyperlinks in Training Plan store?,"Hi folks - 

As I add more training plans to the TrainingPeaks marketplace, I notice that some coaches’ profiles have embedded hyperlinks, rather than a URL copied and pasted into the text.

For example, an offering <https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/cycling/cyclocross/tp-118891/cyclocross-10-weeks-to-peak-masters-advanced-wko-ilevels-free-webinar-cx> by Tim Cusick, compared to a plan <https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/cycling/indoor/tp-228540/8-week-base-indoor-zwift-compatible-w-free-core-workout-plan> from Optimum Coaching.

Is there a way I can create embedded links and upload images to the plan that I offer through your platform?  

I appreciate all the work you and your team do behind the scenes, and thank you for any help / direction you can provide.

My best, 

Steve

Quick question,"Afternoon

I’ve been a premium subscriber for a few years. Just cancelled as I’m dialling my training back for a few months to mend a long standing injury. Now every second interaction with the site pushes me to sign up for a free trail which I don’t want. The site is effectively unusable so just checking if that can be turned off. If not I’ll find a different way to log my training but had hoped to keep the basics going on TP. Looks like there may no longer be a useable free version?

Cheers

Quick business invite: sweat tracking and hydration monitoring," 
Dear team,
 
I am Miranda from Liipoo.com. 
We are a brand that develops wearable hydration monitors for athletes and fitness lovers to track sweat loss and strategize hydration. 
Here is our main product: https://liipoo.com/products/absolutsweat-hydration-biosensor
 
I am writing to to explore deep business cooperation opportunities with you. 
Wonder if you are open to consider sweat test and hydration solutions? 
 
Our development team is led by an international biochemical scientist, Professor Zhangxueji, listed as ""world's top 2% scientists"". 
We mimic lab tests to identify biomarkers in the sweat to determine the water and electrolytes loss, and come with an app that can send you a real-time sweat report and a personalized hydration plan. 
It is tested to be as accurate as sweat lab tests. 
Mainly designed for athletes and avid fitness lovers, we have been a supplier of the 2022 Olympics, also, used by athletes worldwide including Sawan Serasinghe, a 7-time winner of Oceania Championships.
 
If you are interested, we would be highly willing to offer you a sample, so you can test if our sweat monitor can help you better or not. We also welcome your sincere feedback on using our products and will endeavor to improve our products. 

Looking forward to your reply!
 
Miranda

I purchased a package from Coach Steve - But it not compatible ,"I have purchased a program within Training Peaks to use in my gym equipment. I am training on the latest Technogym equipment; my friend's training is fine. Unfortunately, all three trainings I have tried from Steve Coach's program don't work on my equipment. 

I believe that the root of the issue is that his training is based only on heart rate, without pace and distance, so the equipment can't measure it. 
I contacted Coach Steve, who recommended contacting the Trainingpeaks team about the issue. 

Steve Coach's last email:
""Good you figured out the root of the issue.

In terms of your request to convert the plan into pace/time or provide you with a plan that is built that way – I don’t design/build plans that way so cannot help.

What I suggest is you request a refund from Training Peaks (same link as below to request) for my plan and ask them to recommend a marathon plan that better fits your requirements.

Easiest way to get you sync’ed up with preferred training methodology and tech (Personally I don’t believe pace is the right way to improve Age Groupers marathon ability – but other coaches should be able to assist)""

With many thanks,

Hello Barbara,

 

It has come to our attention that you are currently subscribed to TrainingPeaks Premium on two platforms. This can happen when you sign up through both your mobile app store and our website, resulting in your account being billed twice. 


To avoid continuing to be billed for both subscriptions, you need to cancel your mobile subscription. This will not affect your TrainingPeaks account or any of your training data. 

 

Your account has been credited with additional time for the period you were double-subscribed.

Hello Julia,

 

It has come to our attention that you are currently subscribed to TrainingPeaks Premium on two platforms. This can happen when you sign up through both your mobile app store and our website, resulting in your account being billed twice.

Olympic triathlon refund request,"Hey!
I have purchased 16 weeks plan for olympic triathlon. I tried to stick to the plan this week but I found out that 
1. I don’t have good enough technique to do swimming workouts. I need to start going to local classes 
2. At this point it’s very hard to continue with online training I would like to find a dedicated coach because to many things are unknown for me.
I would like to get a refund as I will not follow this plan in the future.
Thank you for considering my request
Best regards

Intermediate to advance training plan,"Hi there- I purchased and have been using the 24 week training plan and am in week 18 of it. I wish u had purchased the Advanced one, and missed the window the swap it out. I have been adding in an extra run and swim and bike each week typically.

Metrics not editable in TraingPeaks Webapp,"Hi,
I'm experiencing the following problem. For a couple of days I can't edit metrics in TrainingPeaks Web app. They appear as shown in screenshot metrics1.jpg. However, they can be edited in the mobile app and once I do some modifications and open them in the Web app again, they become editable there again (see screenshot metrics2.jpg). The error is reproducible with every metric that is created because of some external sync connection (like Garmin or Fitbit).

I know from Uservoice that you are currently implementing a feature to merge all metrics into one, perhaps that's related.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to kindly request a refund for the training program I recently purchased.

Premium vs Basic Athlete Accounts,"Hi,

My name is Michael Grady. I am a long term user of your software from an Athlete Side. I won a Gold Medal in Paris and contribute TP to assisting my team manage the workload.

I recently accepted a coaching position at the University of Washington Men's Rowing team. We are trying to sort out the potential budget and if TP would be useful for our team.

Given your pricing model, we would be at 313.60/month with the number of our athletes to access the ""premium"" athlete account. We would like to have all our staff be members of the shared team. Basically, I would like to get an idea of what we are missing if we keep our athletes as ""basic"" members.

The little checkbox and dash graphic you have is sort of confusing as to what each section actually is. Do you have further information that you can provide that demonstrates the value of each the ""Basic"" and ""Premium"" account types?

Cheers,
Michael Grady"

Structured Workout Sync - Duplicate Workouts,"Hi everyone, 

I am syncing my structured workouts with my garmin account, which - in general - works pretty well. However, if my coach (or myself) moves a workout in TP, e.g. from Monday to Tuesday, I end up with two planned workouts in my Garmin connect calendar: one on Monday and one on Tuesday. This also seems to happen if there are changes made to workouts in TP without moving them; I then end up with two workouts on the same day, i.e. one being the “old” one and one being the one reflecting the changes made in TP. Also, if my coach deletes a workout in TP, it stays in my Garmin connect calendar. Everything else (upload to TP etc) works perfectly fine. 

Do you happen to have a solution for that? 

Thank you very much and best regards from Germany

I have a few questions about the upcoming features for the new strength builder. 

When is planning based on %1RM expected to be added?

What will the analytics look like? will it have total exercise volume (kg)/week, and by exercise/monitoring exercise progression overtime, etc? 

If yes, when are these releases planned? 

Strength training is a super important part of our sport (sprint kayak), and we need a solution more like hevycoach with good analytics, and that's easy for our athletes to use/edit during gym sessions.

Our athletes are happy using TP for their kayak and aerobic training, but we need better strength monitoring, and we'd really love to have all their daily analytics on one platform (in a budget friendly way).

I'd appreciate any more information on developments. Thanks!

I'd like to restart my Premium subscription, so I went in last night to restart, and I believe now I am on the 14 day trial. Which then rolls over into a fully active yearlong subscription.

 

On my subscription status page it says Invalid Subscription. See below:

Coach account,"Hey, please can you help. 

I am starting a new training peaks account - I have started the free 7 day trial - I am 100% sure that I want to continue with the service after this - can I bypass the 7 day trial ? When I go on my settings to subscription and payments , then buy subscription, it takes me back to the begin trial page. 

What happens next after the trial ? I want to start sending my athletes the link to bring them over to the new account asap -is it safe to do so at this point ? It’s a lot of work and I’m scared of doing it and then having to do it all over again after the free trial ? Hope this makes sense.

My scenario is this - I already use training peaks for coaching on my old business partners account. We have decided to part ways. So I need to start a new coaching account which I have set up but it’s on a free  trial but I’d like to set up my payment to training peaks etc. 

I have 24 athletes so I am on the 5+ basic with 1 free premium athlete. I will be upgrading specific athletes to premium over time. 

Please can you confirm if I can start bringing over my athletes to my account on the free trial? 


Thanks

<p dir=""auto"">Thank you for reaching out. I have been looking into your accounts and I believe there has been a slight mixup with your subscription details.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">The account you are actively using is associated with this email address: <a href=""mailto:rossmacdougall6@outlook.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">rossmacdougall6@outlook.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""mailto:rossmacdougall6@outlook.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">rossmacdougall6@outlook.com</a>&gt;&lt;mailto:<a href=""mailto:rossmacdougall6@outlook.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">rossmacdougall6@outlook.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""mailto:rossmacdougall6@outlook.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">rossmacdougall6@outlook.com</a>&gt;&gt;.

(if you do not need this account then I would also suggest deleting the account to avoid further confusion)

<br>3. On August 10th the premium I have added to your primary account will expire, at this point you can re-subscribe to a premium subscription in your primary account.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I apologize for the confusion here and I hope this makes sense. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with on my end.</p>

I am looking to climb Mt Everest in April. I used the Uphill Athlete 24 week program and felt very prepared and fit for Denali. Would you suggest the 24 week course again?

Also, is this significantly different from the course from the Uphill Athlete. It appears there was some sort of parting ways that occurred more recently and I am trying to understand if this is the best program for me. Thanks again for your help.

Hi Sarah

 

I hope your afternoon is going well.

 

I’ve been contacted by a member, Mary Henderson who is trying to upgrade her Training Peaks account but the discount code doesn’t seem to work. I have asked her to send in a screenshot which is attached, would you mind raising this again please?

 

It would be useful to know at what stage the code should be entered as this looks like it is within Google Play, is that correct? I only have the basic TB (FOC) but I daren’t test it in case I sign up for the Premium version during the process!!

 

Many thanks

 

Helen

Workouts are not syncing to Zwift,"The workouts my coach is setting me are not flowing through to Zwift. I have tried disconnecting and reconnecting 10+ times and it still doesn’t work.

Apple watch crashing ,"When using my apple watch ultra for the structured TrainingPeak swims, I noticed that the app has a high tendency to crash whenever I press the lap button. The crash causes the app to close, reopen, and then delete the distance I just completed, moving onto the next set. This doesn't happen for my runs or bikes as far as I know. 
This might be because structured swims on the apple watch is new and needs debugging? I'm unsure and am hoping for some support, as the watch is currently unusable for swims.

Hi again Jakub,

With your trial expiring... are there any lingering questions that I can help resolve?

Don't forget to enter the TPCOACH code to waive the $99 startup fee (good until the end of the month).

Also, if you purchase within the next 2 days, I'll be happy to provide you with a 50% discount code on any of our TrainingPeaks University courses (https://university.trainingpeaks.com/page/all-courses) , just email me back...

It's very hard to track health and fitness, alongside working on businesses.

Aryan here and as I work with apps only, I was confused if I should reach out but your app has good potential. 😊👍🏻

The issues I find out were in the ux side which should be losing you a lot, with lacking onboarding and a proper dashboard design.

Because I have worked with a lot of app startups and have improved their ux, my eye never took another chance to see the potential

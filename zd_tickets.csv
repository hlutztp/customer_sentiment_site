Data Sync from Garmin Connect,"Good morning! I recently joined a triathlon coach who urged me to get on training peaks. Two days ago I signed up and set up my account. I connected TP with Garmin Connect and checked the box for syncing historical data up to five years back so that TP has my athlete profile and workout history. I read your FAQs on syncing with Garmin Connect and ensured I did not terminate my connection with Garmin during the 24 hours it may take to sync.

Unfortunately, none of my workouts synced with my TP account. My new workouts have synced since joining but none of the old ones. I did request my data from Garmin to be able to move them over manually, but doing so one at a time seems like an inefficient way to move data with such robust software. 

Can you help me connect my historical data to TP and get everything running smoothly? 

I look forward to returning to training and learning how to get the most out of trainingpeaks.

Best,
Jacob"

The icons are there but they are not active, I can try to click on them but nothing happens. There is no slider for the rpe scale. Just thought you should know that. I'm starting to use it with my athletes and will let you know their feedback. The database is huge but does not include machines, which is unfortunate or even just a simple KB swing where you only go to your eye height, not overhead american style. I'd like to see that included.

** Case Study: Haile Gebrselassie
------------------------------------------------------------

In the early part of his career, Haile Gebrselassie (https://www.8020endurance.com/dont-ever-be-complacent/?utm_source=80%2F20+Endurance&utm_campaign=60c423bf4e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_OCT2024&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_25b6b08d29-60c423bf4e-517853760&mc_cid=60c423bf4e&mc_eid=UNIQID) was believed to be dominant simply because he had more natural talent than other runners. But the longer his reign of dominance has extended, the more apparent it has become that Geb’s success has as much to do with his mental attitude as with whatever genetic advantages he may have.

** Qualified for Boston?
------------------------------------------------------------

Some runners treat the 26.2-mile trek from Hopkinton to Boylston Street as a celebration. The hard work of qualifying is behind them and they just want to soak up the experience. Others want to run the race of their life in Boston, honoring their qualification by preparing to master its challenging course, unpredictable conditions, and stiff competition.

Boston Boot Camp (https://www.8020endurance.com/qualified-for-boston-read-this/?utm_source=80%2F20+Endurance&utm_campaign=60c423bf4e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_OCT2024&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_25b6b08d29-60c423bf4e-517853760&mc_cid=60c423bf4e&mc_eid=UNIQID) was created to meet the needs of runners in this second group, who wish to leave no stone unturned in the effort to get ready for their best possible performance!

** Training in Cooler Weather
------------------------------------------------------------

Fall means high school cross-country races through the local park. Leaves blanketing the sidewalks and trails. Dusting off those trainers for our indoor cycling workouts.

"Re: Thank you for purchasing the Training Plan, Phil's Intermediate Full Distance Triathlon + Free Email Access to Coach: 28 Weeks","Hi Phil! 

Pleasure to speak to you, I have been interested in purchasing one of your full distance training plans for some time now and finally pulled the trigger earlier today. 

I'm due to start my training plan on Monday 4th November for Ironman Klagenfurt (15th June 2025), but I realised after purchasing the 28 week intermediate plan that I need the 32 week plan instead. 

I realised this after paying and before applying the training plan to my training peaks calendar. Is there any way I could swap the one I purchased out for a 32 week plan and the difference of course. 

Thank you so much for your help and I'm looking forward to getting started! 

Much appreciated,

Changing plan ,Hi! I purchased a 20 week marathon training plan but need to change it to a 16 week plan. How do I make that change? I just purchased it yesterday 
Refund ,I’d like to get a refund for my recent purchased training plan. For the simple reason that I thought it would connect automatically to my garmin watch. The plan I selected did not offer that option. Thank you.

SCHEDULED: Taylor Evans meeting Tony - FREE 1:1 Consult with a TrainingPeaks Pro ($99 Value),"Hi Tony, 

Hope you're well! I just had an issue where two of my self-paid premium athletes dropped off my account. 

How do I upgrade my subscription to get them back on my dashboard? I now can't see them in my dashboard. 

 Hoping to get this sorted today as I have some athlete calls tomorrow morning and need to be able to see their data. 

Thanks!

Perfect, Taylor!

I've linked yourself as an athlete in there. Feel free to link a few athletes to start planning for them as well...

You can still communicate with them while on basic. I'd suggest going to the ""home"" tab and filter notifications by comments to follow up with them right away... please find the differences between basic and premium, from the coach perspective here (https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204072624-Basic-Athlete-vs-Premium-Athlete-account-for-Coaches) .

Thanks, Tony! Nice to meet you as well - and thanks again for taking the time to meet with me earlier.

I've just set up an athlete account using my personal email (taylorevans0602@gmail.com). 

Would you be able to link my coaching / athlete accounts so that I can play around in the dashboards? 

Also, one quick question on the basic plan from the athlete's view - are you able to trade messages / notes with your coach through the platform or do you need a premium account for that service?

Thanks!

Pago fallido,"Buenas tardes!!
Me han intentado y conseguido robar dinero desde la tarjeta de credito esta semana (lunes) por lo cuál esta tarjeta está bloqueada.
He pedido una nueva pero mientras no la tenga, no podré activarla y proceder al pago.
En cuanto la tenga, actualizo los datos y pago la factura pendiente.
Siento la molestia y gracias por entenderlo.
Un saludo.

Had 2 premium athletes drop off my account,"I just had an issue where two of my self-paid premium athletes dropped off my account. How do I upgrade my subscription to get them back on my dashboard? I now can't see them in my dashboard, but the premium coach plan options seems to only include 1 premium athlete so I'm confused since they are self-paid.

 Hoping to get this sorted today as I have some athlete calls tomorrow morning and need to be able to see their data! Please advise."
Refund,"Hello,
I purchased the wrong plan and would like to request a refund.

Hi, I just started the mountaineering course, and I love it, but I am disappointed the RPE course I chose does not link to Apple Watch. I have been following the plan for three days, and I'm writing to see if I could change to a different plan that will work for my Apple watch. I love the plan and ideally want to stay doing something similar but one that allows me to send it to my watch to keep me on track during my trainings. Thanks for considering. I would hate to have to buy another plan."

I am Domenico Vicari a PhD student with the University of Verona, and I am involved in developing new performance and biomechanical models in the various disciplines of cycling.

During the experimental study, we would like to use your platform to monitor the training parameters of the recruited athletes. Would you like to support us in our research? Of course, we would like to mention you in future scientific publications coming from this project. If interested, I will send you all the specifics of the research project.

TrainingPeaks iOS App,"HI, Just today I had my annual subscription renewed. I have not been using trading peaks for some time as my health has deteriorated and I am unable to exercise at all. That should be visible to you, in fact I do not believe that I have used Training Peaks for close to 2 years. Are you able to close my account and refund the annual contribution to me please ? Thanks Robert Green."

TrainingPeaks iOS App,"I have a question in regards to coaching accounts. I'm starting to coach some clients. So I need to create a coaching account correct? I saw there are two options. 4 athletes or more than 4 athletes. Am i able to upgrade at any time if I start with the 4. I pay for premium TP for myself. With a coaching profile, would I have the same access like the premium I pay for? If so then would I be able to cancel my premium account if I would have access with a coaching account. Hopefully this makes sense"

Hello, 

More than merely following up on my recent application for Customer Support Representative, I want to express my sincere appreciation for the ethos of Peaksware (TrainingPeaks, et al.) and the training tools you offer, capable, in the hands of athletes and musicians, of sculpting their goals into reality. Never before have I seen the two groups melded, so as a seasoned competitive runner and music lover, it's refreshing and inspiring. 

Though I might be overqualified for this position, I'm still interested in learning more about the organization's needs. It would also be a pleasure to discuss my career journey, possibly exploring any mutual alignment between us, should you decide to move forward. 

Appreciatively,
Ethan Knox"

Metrics display rollout messed up (3 Oct UTC),"There was a new release deployed to the web version on 3 Oct (UTC) that included changes to how metrics are displayed, edited, & added.  It's a complete fail.  Please rollback the change.

Metric entry date (for manually added metric) is displayed in UTC - I specified 7:07am AEST (which is UTC+10 at the moment) and it's displaying as 9:07pm.  However, automatic entries from my Garmin watch & scales display in the local time zone.

The layout of the fields is horrible - way too spaced out, very user unfriendly.

I cannot edit existing metrics entries (e.g. to add more data, such as sleep quality or overall feeling).

If I click on a metric entry to show it, the subjective measurements (sleep quality, fatigue, soreness, overall feeling) display as numbers, which are basically meaningless to the user, rather than the ""poor, good, average, high, extremely poor, etc"" that you used to get and still show on the home page or when you hover over an entry on the calendar.

Bug with peak performances + data,"there is a bug with workouts that are imported from apple health, and it makes peak performances ENTIRELY useless.

If the workout is paused/power meter drops out, when it resumes the power is joined linear interpolation between when it stopped + when it resumes. This means that if you stop and it disconnects for >1 minute, then when it resumes at high power it will create a very high one minute (or longer, depending on the pause/dropout) peak at the end of this interpolation.

I am going to cancel my subscription, as this makes any historical data questionable and annoying. I can't reprocess it to fix it. Fixing it manually doesn't even work as suggested with the ""fix"" as the regions appear correctly as no data on the browser (but still erroneously count as ""peak performances"" and reanalyze doesn't fix here either)

"All of a sudden, the Metrics are HUGE. Which is aw...","All of a sudden, the Metrics are HUGE. Which is awful, but I can deal with that. What I can't deal with is not being able to edit the metrics and half of the data that I have under settings to display is also missing. Every morning my whoop sends data to training peaks and this morning all of a sudden I can't edit the data and all the non-sleep metrics data is missing.
Please fix this, this was an awful update and now not functional.

As a side note, when I was copying over weeks yesterday for next years training plan it would skip workouts in the week. Like it would just miss some of the sessions when copying over so I'd have to re-copy that session into a certain day to make it whole. And it would re-order the workouts when copying them over. 
Seems like the latest update had a LOT of bugs.

Credit Card locked,"Dear Customer Support,

Just for your information, I am currently not able to update the payment method and will be able to do so in approximately 10 days.

My bank locked my credit card due to the first transaction for my trainingpeaks coach account, because they thought it might be some fraud activity going on. Sadly I did not get the information fast enough to intervent the locking. Currently I am waiting for a new card that I can then add to my account and enable the payment of my coaching abo. This will take approximately 7-10 days.

Best regards
Tobias Klaus"
Re: Thank you for your TrainingPeaks payment,"Dear Training Peak team,

I have checked that you have charged my account for the new annuity, although I have not received any notice or request to do so. I just wanted to tell you that due to my recent paternity I have not had time to train and I am not giving the expected use to the application.

That is why I would like to unsubscribe from the application for the moment and waiting to have more time. for this reason I would appreciate that you rescind my license and proceed to reimburse me the money you have charged me in the account. I am very sad not to continue with the application because I like it very much and I see it very useful in training, but I find it impossible to give it the use I would like.

thanks in advance,

receive a cordial greeting,
Santiago Estebaranz.

I noticed the website app just changed the way ""metrics"" popup works in the calendar.
More specifically in regard to Garmin and ithelete HRV scores.  I use ithelete for my daily HRV readings and Garmin devices for daily/sleep tracking and recording workouts.
When the Garmin connect app records a daily HRV I then have both Garmin and ithete scores, which are not close to one another, in ""metrics"".  
Prior to the recent change I would simply go into the ""metrics"" popup and manually edit/delete the Garmin HRV value and with the recent change it is no longer editable.
Any advice on how I might discard/disregard Garmin daily HRV.
Thank you!

Adding workouts or notes to ALL athletes at once.,"I want to add a note to all athletes at once.  I see an older version of TP that shows hovering over the date you can add to all athletes in that group at once, but this option no longer exists?  I understand about copy and paste but its time consuming.  Let me give a simple example, I have 50 athletes in one group and want to wish them a Happy New Year but do not want to copy and paste 50 notes on January 1st.  How do I accomplish this in one action in todays version of TP?"
TrainingPeaks iOS App,"Hi there!
Question regarding Fitness/Form/Fatigue: I see that the numbers update after midnight to reflect the next day’s values. 
I’m wondering what’s the reasoning for not updating fatigue/form as soon as the workout is done? For example, today I did a somewhat hard workout already in form -20 (this morning) but after the workout, the form is still -20. 
I think the values should reflect the newly done damage sooner vs later, so it’s easier to plan/preview the next day.

Coach Support,"Hi there,

I currently have an athlete who was using TrainingPeaks before our club recently purchased a coaching account. This athlete is required to submit their TrainingPeaks to our provincial sport organization and currently has them listed as her head coach. When she tried to add me as a coach was presented with a message saying she cannot add another coach.

Just wondering if there is a work around for this? As I am new to TrainingPeaks and hoping to get the most out of our subscription. Let me know your thoughts.


Best,

Importing Workout Results from Apple Watch,"I use an Apple Ultra watch to record my walking workouts, and lately don’t check Training Peaks often to see if it is picking up the workout results.  (These are just open walks, not authored workouts from TP, I don’t use that feature on walks).  Usually it takes a few hours to make sure Apple and TP sync up, but now I am getting nothing, and there appears to be an import page in TP that only looks at the last 7 days.  Is that a new restriction?  I have something like 8 months of workouts in the Apple Fitness app that I need to copy over to TP.

Thanks in advance for your help!

TrainingPeaks iOS App,"Hello. I just subscribed for 1 year 100usd with a 20% promo code, but it was saying the currency will be adjusted based on my address. However it went through confirmed status immediately without further confirmation, so now it is much more expensive for me. I recall from the app purchase the amount was available in Turkish Lira with 2.999TL. I kindly ask your support to refund the USD amount withdrawn and charge with the Turkish Lira 2.999 x 80% = 2.400 Turkish Lira. Thanks. Muratcan Akyil"

setting up TP for Andrew Frommer,"Hi Andrew,


We need you to make a “coach account” with training peaks.  You sign up for a new account (I would use your endurance 2 perform email) and it is $19.00/mos, but it will ultimately go under my billing plan once we move it over.  It is also $99 start up, but it is waived with the coupon code TPCOACH.     Keep in mind that if you ever leave coaching with E2P, that $19/mos will be your responsibility unless you cancel the coach account. 

 

Once you have created this account, please replay all so Henry can add you to my account. 

 

In health,

TrainingPeaks iOS App,Hello there I seem to have 2 accounts on training peaks. Can you help me resolve this?
interested in one of your training plans,"Good Afternoon,
I am interested in selecting one of your training plans.  I am looking for some direction as to which plan would be best for me.  Just to give you a little background, I've been in triathlon sports for the past 5 years and I've completed twelve 1/2 Ironman distance races to date.  Hoping to tackle my first full end of September 2025.  I consider myself to be at an intermediate/competitive level (I usually finish within the top 20% of my age group).  Looking for a plan that has 2-3 swims/bike/runs per week with 1-2 sessions of strength training as well.  Looking to get started with training for the full around the start of the year (I have the Ironman 70.3 world championship race in NZ mid December and plan to recover after the race for 2-3 weeks after that).  Thanks for your help and guidance.

No se si escribir en español o inglés, pero como me aparece la página en español así lo haré. Si necesitan que hablemos en inglés no tengo problema.

Tengo mucha relación con un coach (Jesús MQ - martinquero@gmail.com) que recientemente se unió a TrainingPeaks por recomendación mía, y nos gustaría compartir algunas carpetas del Workout Library para compartir entrenamientos y aprender como entrenadores el uno del otro.

He creado en mi perfil varias carpetas, que pueden localizar al final de la librería porque comienzan por la letra Z-***, pero si la carpeta la he creado yo, solo yo puedo agregar entrenamientos y él solamente puede verlos (y copiárselos). Si la carpeta la ha creado él (como la que pone Z-QUERO, yo sólamente puedo verlos, pero no agregar más entrenamientos a esa carpeta. 

Nuestra idea como coaches es tener varias carpetas (Swim, Bike, Run, Fuerza, Tests...) donde compartir entrenamientos que nos parecen interesantes...pero que los dos podamos agregar entrenamientos a dicha carpeta.

Cómo podemos hacerlo?

Agrego captura para que vean de qué carpetas estamos hablando.

Mi compañero Coach en cuestión es Jesús MQ, cuyo perfil está bajo el email: martinquero@gmail.com

Quedo a la espera de vuestra respuesta, agradeciendo de antemano la ayuda.

Un saludo.

New strength training functionality ,"Hi. I have started using the new strength feature - for the most part it is really nice, I really appreciate to be able to check one set at the time to be complete, one of these really stupid small motivators that actually work (for me) to get all the sets green and done and not skip something here and there.

My problem is that I use my smartwatch to record time and HR during the session. I know it is not accurate but at least I get some kind of value for TSS that I can then modify if I find it too small or too large. And when you complete a workout using the strength feature it seems impossible to merge that activity with the one recorded by the watch, meaning I get two sessions in my calendar and that time is counted doubly. It also seems impossible to change registered time in the strength feature.

Is there a fix for this - I kind of like the feature in general and would prefer not switching back to using the old strength module?"

I would like to ask for your help. The following is happening with one of my athletes: after the training has been uploaded to the garmin (with the training zones well defined both on the garmin and on the tp), the intensity of the training is lower than requested.

After uploading the workout to the garmin
 3 x 10' 220 - 240w

Any reason why this is happening?

Structured Workout Sync - Duplicate Workouts,"Hi everyone, 

I am syncing my structured workouts with my garmin account, which - in general - works pretty well. However, if my coach (or myself) moves a workout in TP, e.g. from Monday to Tuesday, I end up with two planned workouts in my Garmin connect calendar: one on Monday and one on Tuesday. This also seems to happen if there are changes made to workouts in TP without moving them; I then end up with two workouts on the same day, i.e. one being the “old” one and one being the one reflecting the changes made in TP. Also, if my coach deletes a workout in TP, it stays in my Garmin connect calendar. Everything else (upload to TP etc) works perfectly fine. 

Do you happen to have a solution for that? 

Thank you very much and best regards from Germany

Refund,"Hello,

I ordered a training plan recently to start in the middle of October. However, last week I was hit while riding my bike and sustained several injuries and now have to rethink my training process and timeline.

I really liked, and prefer, the previous method of containing both types of metrics together in a single calendar window. The attached graphic file (*.png) shows, in green arrows, the preferred calendar ""window"" vs. today's new method, in red arrows.

I have a few questions about the upcoming features for the new strength builder. 

When is planning based on %1RM expected to be added?

What will the analytics look like? will it have total exercise volume (kg)/week, and by exercise/monitoring exercise progression overtime, etc? 

If yes, when are these releases planned? 

Strength training is a super important part of our sport (sprint kayak), and we need a solution more like hevycoach with good analytics, and that's easy for our athletes to use/edit during gym sessions.

Our athletes are happy using TP for their kayak and aerobic training, but we need better strength monitoring, and we'd really love to have all their daily analytics on one platform (in a budget friendly way).

I'd appreciate any more information on developments. Thanks!

Missing data after import,"Dear Mr./Mrs.

For the second time in 3 weeks now, one of my athletes data is missing after they imported their workout. All of the other times it just worked fine and I was able to analyse the data but for these two cases it says there’s “no data available”. The device they’re registering on is an Apple Watch Series 6 and she just follow the scheduled training that comes into her workout app. (In the attachment I shared the screen I get to see when I press analyse. Do you have any idea on how we could resolve this issue? 

Thank you in advance.

ATP adjustments,"Hi,
I'm doing strength training with a coach and cycling on my own.
I'm planning to create an ATP for cycling, however I cannot know the periodization of my strength training, this differs during the year based on the actual program.
If I create an ATP and also add my strength training (I can add calories burnt and HR after the session) - which I can only do after each session - does that adjust my cycling plan?
Or do I have to scale down my ATP for the weeks where my strength training gets too tough manually?
Thanks.

Premium vs Basic Athlete Accounts,"Hi,

My name is Michael Grady. I am a long term user of your software from an Athlete Side. I won a Gold Medal in Paris and contribute TP to assisting my team manage the workload.

I recently accepted a coaching position at the University of Washington Men's Rowing team. We are trying to sort out the potential budget and if TP would be useful for our team.

Given your pricing model, we would be at 313.60/month with the number of our athletes to access the ""premium"" athlete account. We would like to have all our staff be members of the shared team. Basically, I would like to get an idea of what we are missing if we keep our athletes as ""basic"" members.

The little checkbox and dash graphic you have is sort of confusing as to what each section actually is. Do you have further information that you can provide that demonstrates the value of each the ""Basic"" and ""Premium"" account types?

Cheers,
Michael Grady"

Vulnerability: Failure to invalidate session on Password Change,"Hello team,
Hope you are fine. I am a security researcher and have found some bugs/vulnerabilities in your website.

Vulnerability: Failure to invalidate session on Password Change

I have observed that when we change ""Password"" from one browser in place of session expiration from other browser it just updates password from other browser and the old session gets updated without being logout.

Steps to check Session Management issue On Password change:
1- Login from two browser at a time [From Chrome browser and from Mozilla Firefox].
2- Change password in settings from chrome browser.
3- Now Check Mozilla Firefox.
4- Your Session got ""updated"" in place of expiration.

Recommendations:
If Session is Updating from one Browser so other should expire first to renew session after login.

Hi Sarah

 

I hope your afternoon is going well.

 

I’ve been contacted by a member, Mary Henderson who is trying to upgrade her Training Peaks account but the discount code doesn’t seem to work. I have asked her to send in a screenshot which is attached, would you mind raising this again please?

 

It would be useful to know at what stage the code should be entered as this looks like it is within Google Play, is that correct? I only have the basic TB (FOC) but I daren’t test it in case I sign up for the Premium version during the process!!

 

Many thanks

Simone here, apologies for my random email about figuring out my training peaks accounts.

You might not be the right person for this but maybe you can send or address me in the right direction please.

I have since last year a coaching account where I pay monthly the fees, I also had my individual premium account which I didn’t know was on auto renew and just charger me for the year.
As I have added myself to my coaching account , that means I don’t use my private account and certainly don’t want to pay twice for the same deal if that makes sense.
Who do I need to contact to get my money transferred back , I would really appreciate your help please.

Thanks for your time on Friday and your reply.

With the strength training, I understand that I cannot get the workout uploaded to any device to follow.  However, the bigger problem for me is that if I add a new strength session to the calendar, then when I record a strength session on my Fenix 6 as a strength workout, this does not automatically match with the planned strength session and it will not let me pair it in TP manually - I assume it thinks they are different session types.  Can you confirm that this is the case? And can you find out if this will be fixed very soon?  At the moment there is no point me using the next strength type if I cannot use it like this.

Thanks

I just double checked with our technical team, and unfortunately the new strength workouts cannot be exported to devices at the moment. Using your phone will be the best practice right now, I'm sure this will change in the near future.

Here’s a quick recap of the key points we discussed and more:

-  How to easily create a training plan (https://app.salesforceiq.com/r?target=5f19cb1bc9e77c00761eb4a4&t=AFwhZf0dFzbCRZYIjQ5OqiFvJeD1eI6fxTe9-ahPISwVbaz-z1RI5mDxLzwVksWbOzDUJBD405-AT7_03GScMwTAUCCZBwQRT-Zz8rKMNo-zCU8a6OqIW0Ktq-xaXbvcsUoB0WuAIaCO&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.trainingpeaks.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F204072514-How-to-Create-a-New-Training-Plan-Coaches-only-)  and apply it to an athlete's calendar (https://app.salesforceiq.com/r?target=5f19cb1bc9e77c00761eb4a6&t=AFwhZf0dFzbCRZYIjQ5OqiFvJeD1eI6fxTe9-ahPISwVbaz-z1RI5mDxLzwVksWbOzDUJBD405-AT7_03GScMwTAUCCZBwQRT-Zz8rKMNo-zCU8a6OqIW0Ktq-xaXbvcsUoB0WuAIaCO&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.trainingpeaks.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F204072574-How-to-Apply-a-Training-Plan-to-your-Athlete-s-) .

Complaint / Cancellation / Goodwill,"Dear peaksware,

Although I no longer wanted TrainingPeaks Premium, it was extended for 1 year. I would also like to stress that the subscription was automatically extended against my wishes without informing me in good time about an upcoming contract extension. On September 30, 2024, an amount of 124.99 USD was charged to my credit card.

I request that you refund me the amount of 124.99 USD and cancel the subscription. Otherwise, I will inform the legal protection agency and take legal action.

I would be grateful for a reply.

Kind regards,

Me gustaría saber si habría alguna opción de recibir el dinero de una de las compras ya que me cobraron dos veces lo que cuesta la version mensual pero sin poder ver apenas nada en la primera. 

Gracias.

<br>   Hi Team, 
<br> &nbsp; 
<br> My name is Anna (Partnership Manager at FanFuel Network) and I’m interested in discussing business opportunities with you.&nbsp; 
<br> &nbsp; 
<br> I noticed that you have funnels suitable to our offers. This one here for example: <a href=""https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/creatine-for-endurance-athletes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/creatine-for-endurance-athletes/</a>

<br> The brand I had in mind is called&nbsp;Ultimate CRN-5 from Crazy Nutrition. You can check the website here: <a href=""https://crazynutrition.com/products/ultimate-crn-5?variant=41969505632427"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://crazynutrition.com/products/ultimate-crn-5?variant=41969505632427</a>
<br> 
<br>   
<br> Crazy Nutrition’s Ultimate CRN-5 is a creatine powder formulated with 5 different types of creatine. Crafted with additional electrolytes, &nbsp;it will boost your energy, maintain hydration, support lean muscle mass and give you more strength to bring your training to the next level.&nbsp; 
<br>   
<br> We use the first touch tracking, pay 40% per sale, as well as reward affiliates for all repeat orders, which makes us very unique when compared against our competition. 
<br>   
<br> Is this something you’d be potentially interested in? If so, please let me know as I’ll be more than happy to advise on the best ways to promote this brand. 
<br>   
<br> You can sign up to our partner program from here: <a href=""https://partners.fanfuel.co/affiliate/signup?p=2KQWFS21"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://partners.fanfuel.co/affiliate/signup?p=2KQWFS21</a>

merging two plans,"This is actually George's dad. He is currently on a free plan with his cross country ski coach Mike Lessard as the attached coach. George previously had a training plan with CXC academy that went to an account in my name.

Sometimes my planned workouts (based on time and pace range) have an estimated distance, and sometimes they not.
This bothers me because I cannot se the planned distance in the week summary, and it always looks like I have done my distance then planned.

I have noticed that, when trying to create workouts, if I input the information on the summary fields, the expected distance is calculated. But, if I use instead workout bocks, there is no estimated distance.
Is there anyway to show the expected distance for all the workouts?
I have screenshots that might explain it better.
I will be happy to hear suggestions!

As you know, as of today, when you plan a swim workout from TP , only meters or time are synced... but the notes you can write (to know what kind of material to use, or the name of the exercise, etc) are not. And the truth is that it would be very useful. </p>

Using TP in the Android app, I just had all my planned workouts for next week and today's completed workout shown twice on my calendar and home view. So I went ahead and deleted all the duplicates. However, now after restarting the app, there are now no workouts. So I apparently lost today's workout as well as all the planned workouts going forward. 

That is obviously a rather annoying bug. I. Case you have the possibility to restore.y deleted data, it would be much appreciated. Also, maybe this issue of showing duplicates is worth looking into. 

Thanks and best,
Thomas"

Re: Ann Change of Password Request,"If a workout is not programmed into Training Peaks, can it be imported to Training Peaks?  For example:  If I do my own 2-hour ride using my Wahoo Elemnt computer, can I export that ride data from Wahoo to Training Peaks to view data?  Or would that require a paid official account? I currently have an account but haven't been able to successfully export ride data from Wahoo Elemnt to TP.

Pairing,"Guten Tag, die App ist ja schon gar nicht barrierefrei, Inhalte werden abgeschnitten und passen nicht. Einheiten kann man nicht pairen oder trennen. Bisher funktionierte es mit Handy aber in der Webversion. Wie kann ich heute meine Laufaktivität mit dem heutigen Lauftraining OHNE PC pairen??? Es muss doch heutzutage bei dem Preis möglich sein, ohne PC auszukommen. Aufeinander schieben funktioniert nicht mehr! Danke."

Garmin Metrics Glitch,"Hi TrainingPeaks,

I’m always getting this Metrics window popping up on my TrainingPeaks. Once it’s there I can’t get rid of it and stays on top of everything. Plus I can then no longer access the Athlete list menu.

 

Very annoying.

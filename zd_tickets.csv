I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter as soon as possible, as I am eager to get started with the training plan.

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to your prompt response."
training plan ended one week early,"The training program that I purchased ended ne week too soon. It was my mistake, not yours. I thought a coach would be checking in with me but that never happened.

Can someone help me plan just a few workouts this week leading up to my big event (USAT nats in Atlantic City on Saturday)?

Should I repeat my first week? Or maybe my last (step-down) week? Or something else?

 

THANKS!

Refund of my purchase,"Trainning peaks accidentally auto-renewed my premium account when my free mobth ended, and had to pay 150$, which is such a big cost for me, and I am very disappointed because before renewing it, it didn't warn me at all. I didn't want to get the premium after my free trial."

I've followed the steps on here and on Coros' webpage. On my Coros app it'll show that I'm ""connected"" but there's 5 white dots between my watch icon and the training peaks icon and only 4 of those dots are full.
On the Training Peaks app, under Devices and App connections, my Coros doesn't even show up.
On the webpage is says my watch has Read/Write permission.
How can I get them to pair/connect?
Any help would be hugely appreciated!
Thanks,

I rely heavily on the Fatigue, Fitness, and Form numbers provided.  My complaint is that the algorithm that calculates these scores is flawed.  I did a 3.49 mi hike in 6:32 hours with an elevation gain of 2644 and an avg HR of 132.  This workout only scored a TSS value of 6 (see attached image).      I can do a 30 min treadmill run/walk and score TSS value of 33 (see attached).  How can a hike where I burn almost 2500 kcal only score a 6 and a short treadmill run/walk score 33?  The hike certainly has a greater fitness value.

I appreciate your help with this.

I will attach the files to see if you can upload them to my account.

I'm 46 yrs and have been training for 6 weeks now with your plan for my first ever sprint triathlon (I used to run half and full marathons in my youth and have been swimming for some years.) The thing is, I started having hip pain this last 3-4 days and it became stronger since yesterday. I can walk and move. I'm a surgeon myself and I know it's just because of this new running load for my body. Beside usual care of this joint, what do you recommend regarding my training plan for my sprint which is happening in two weeks? Decrease exercise, stop completely or what is your advice?

Hello TP Team, 

I started training with my coach on TP, and everything went fine, i always received every notification that happened on my Gmail account and notification from my TrainingPeaks mobile app, and then suddenly it just stop sending me messages, i really like that feature because i knew when my coach commented on my last workout, and i was notified instantly, now i only get gmail notification when a new plan for workout is uploaded and thats all, i tried pretty much everything.. i checked and refreshed my notifications in iPhone settings for TrainingPeaks mobile app, i reinstalled it and it still doesn't work, i even check here in chrome browser to set settings but nothing work, i would be glad to solve this issue.

Thank you in advance,

Request to change plan ,"Dear TrainingPeaks Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. On September 6th, I purchased a training plan from TrainingPeaks, not realizing that RPE-based plans are not supported by the Apple Watch. I’ve purchased many other plans in the past and was unaware of this limitation. Unfortunately, I only discovered the issue after setting the plan to start on September 9th.

I specifically chose a simple running plan because I’m coming off an injury, and I wasn’t expecting this particular plan to be incompatible. I don’t recall seeing any indication that RPE would not be supported for Apple Watch users, which is why this caught me by surprise.

I understand that there is a 24-hour return policy, but since I didn’t realize the issue until I started the plan, I’m not seeking a refund. Instead, I would simply like to change my current training plan to another one that is compatible with the Apple Watch.

As a loyal customer who has purchased many plans in the past, I hope we can find a solution that works for both sides.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance!

Best regards,
Rodrigo Ibarra"

"Hi, I changed my watch to a Garmin Forerunner 955 ...","Hi, I changed my watch to a Garmin Forerunner 955 and now the TSS scores are dramatically different than what was recorded by Training Peaks when I logged runs on my Apple Watch. The values are orders of magnitude different. I believe the pre-Garmin values were correct as they were consistent with my Suunto watch values from several years ago. Is there something I can do to address this?

Certain Data Not Syncing from Garmin to Training Peaks,"Hi,

For some reason elevation gain and elevation loss data are not being pulled from my Garmin Connect app over to training peaks. My coach is having to go in and manually tell Training Peaks to autocorrect it in every workout in order for it to show up. Is there a way to have that data automatically go from Garmin Connect to Training Peaks?

Thanks,
Chris Armstrong"

On the Calendar I just would like to see the activities that I do, no other information but this has proven to be a challenge for me, I have watched you tube videos and tried many things on the app and on the watch but the Resting Heart Rate keeps appearing every day that I use my Garmin watch for a sport activity.

I am about to sign a 6th athlete so I was going to upgrade...but it turns out I'm already upgraded. Is there any way to get reimbursed for the months of paying for more than 5 athletes?

In addition, I pay for each of my athletes to be upgraded from a basic account to a premium account. As far as I understand it though, I'm supposed to get one free upgrade. It looks like I'm paying for all of the upgrades though. Can you help me out with that?

Dynamic Plan Application Missing Workouts,"Hi Alec,

We have encountered an issue with a Dynamic Plan we use. We use this plan to share group workouts between coaches.

The plan below is in Lance Watson’s account (User Name: LW2004)

 

When applied to the athletes listed, 5 structured workouts are missing between October 1st and December 31st.

Bikes: 10/3, 10/8, 10/12

Runs: 10/16, 10/23

 

Solutions tried for my account (Coach Dan). Clearing Chrome history. This didn’t work.

Eventually I copied the workouts directly into my athlete calendar.

 

Perhaps the plan is too long? Should we keep the Dynamic plan to 1 year?

Can you help here?

 

Thanks

Apple Watch activities syncinc to training peaks,"I am having issues syncing my workouts from my Apple Watch and Apple Fitness to TrainingPeaks. I use a third party app through Apple/Watch called Workoutdoors to record my activities. These activities are then shared and uploaded to Apple Health/Fitness.

Pa:HR / PW:HR are different in the webclient (before elevation correction) and on the mobile ,"Dear TP Support team,
I struggle with the Pa:HR / PW:HR metrics. The attached case is from my girlfriends' account, with her consent. But the same applies to my data as well.
In short, when opening the mobile app, it shows a certain Pw:Hr - and on the web, it's called Pa:HR, it is different from the mobile app - but when the elevation correction is applied, its name changes to Pw:Hr and it will match the value in the mobile app.
Our coach monitors this value closely, and she was told everything is really very fine, Pa:HR<1% - but it looks very different in the mobile app.
Which value should we believe?
I also asked our coach if he uses the elevation correction, and the answer was no. And no need to... In fact, this is hard to believe.
To make it even more interesting - I use stryd and still, the difference exists. How come? How can I make sure that my recorded power data is used to calculate this metrics?
Thank you for the clarification and best regards

Please see below instructions on British Triathlon website

The Coach Edition Unlimited is a monthly billed system as there is has a number of options/add ons – so you will be billed by invoice. Therefore, to claim your 20% coach discount you must send proof/documentation of your certification as a British Triathlon qualified coach to support@trainingpeaks.com<mailto:support@trainingpeaks.com> and the 20% discount will then be added to your account.

TrainingPeaks iOS App,"No puedo iniciar sesión desde el ordenador, necesito ayuda"
TrainingPeaks iOS App,Hey. I started training a few weeks ago for a marathon I have coming up in November. After a long run a week or so I had some discomfort in my achilles. It persisted for a few days so I took 10 days off for it to heal. It feels better now and I feel almost ready to get back to training. I’ve altered my goals for the race bearing in mind I am likely to now only be able to train for 8-9 weeks. I wanted to ask whether someone can help me to tailor my training plan so that I can ease myself back in and avoid injury and still get myself to a good level and peak in time for the race. Thanks!

Workouts disappear later in the day. ,"Hi There, 
I have an issues with workouts that are downloaded to a wahoo Roam. They download just fine but if I chooses to do the workout later in the day, say 8PM, the workouts automatically disappear from both the Wahoo App and from the Bolt. This happens regardless of the time I download the workout. If I do not download the workout until later in the day, say 8PM or later, the workout will just not download from training peaks at all.

group training plans,"Hi there

I am enquiring on behalf of my triathlon club about the feasibility of using Training Peaks as a platform to deliver plans to our athletes as a group.

Basically, we would need to share a training plan to a group of athletes for different race distances, depending on the individual goal of the athlete.    e.g.  sprint event, olympic, 70.3 and full Ironman distances

I'm not sure if Training Peaks would have this functionality or if you have any ideas around how we could make something like this work for us as a club and would appreciate any advice you may have regarding this, and also the cost us as a club.

Many thanks

I know TP automatically calculates Peak Performances, but I'm looking for a specific interval. For example, I'm looking to answer something like ""What was my best 150 meter sprint during my ride on Sept 14?"" I know I can use the post-ride analysis and zoom in to certain sections, but I have a tough time getting a specific interval (like the 150m noted above). I've attached a ride graph for the exact situation noted above for reference...only one of the selected intervals is exactly 150m (0.15km) and even with that I'm not sure it's the ""best"" 150m.

Login issue and Unhiding sessions,"Good day, 
This morning, when trying to log into my TP coaching account through my google chrome browser, it simply keeps returning to the login page with the following in the URL bar:
https://home.trainingpeaks.com/login?ReturnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.trainingpeaks.com%2F

If I go into google browser as a guest or if I use Safari, it logs in successfully. Do you perhaps know what I can do to rectify this? 
The other thing is that I cannot unhide multiple sessions. Normally I would click the three dots on the left side, next to a full week and the pop up allows me to select 'unhide' or I could select multiple weeks by clicking and the clicking while holding down shift. But the unhide option is not showing? It cannot be that I have to now unhide one session at a time. 

I would appreciate feedback on these two issues.
Thank you in advance"
Unable to get activities set-up on Training Peaks,"Hi, I have 100s of recent activities that have not synced to Training Peaks from Garmin. I'm aware that these can be moved manually but I do not have the time for this and when I did try it is not perfect - activities are called things like 'other' which I do not have the time to manually change.

Training Peaks is therefore not useful for me as none of the analysis is relevant. I have read all of the articles on how to move over activites so at this point I just want to cancel please as I will not be able to make use of the premium account.

Thank you for your understanding, Neil."

Create an account for a sports club and Add Coaches.,"I am writing to you from a triathlon sports club in Madrid (Triatlon Valdebebas), and I have been given your contact information by Kika Escobar, Marketing Director of the Spanish Triathlon Federation.

How can I create an account for a sports club? We have coaches trained by the Spanish Triathlon Federation and others who are not. We are informed that these coaches who have a Spanish Tri coaching certificate have a discount on the backend.

What is the procedure to create everything in an orderly manner? Our coaches already have their simple trainingpeaks coach account.

We await your response.

Running Power Vs Cycling Power and TSS,"Hi there, 
I am both a cyclist and runner, and use power during both of those activities. I cannot seem to get my zones to reflect a seperatation between cycling power and running power. When I update one, the other is also updated. I've gone in an added a power type for running specifically, but that has not fixed it either. I'd like to have to distinct power zones for running and cycling, so that when I do both in a week, I can more easily see the total TSS.

"PROBLEMS WITH WEEK ""HIDE"" UTILITY-TRAINNER","Good morning, I am writing as a trainer and a recent problem, as the previous week was available and now is disabled the function of “hide” not or yes days before.
As far as I can see, you can “hide” in the current week, but not the following week, as I usually prepare certain formations and let you see them on Sunday night (I am writing from Madrid/Spain).
If it would be possible to use this utility again, what other solution would you give us, since it has been a utility that I have been using for years.

Thank you, kind regards.

In anothers like 6 September 2024 the system shows the hear rate distribution chart but it doesn’t show heart rate by zone. The message is “no data available”.(File attached) It’s the same with all of the workouts of September.

I've just purchased the training plan: 8 WEEKS TO FAST, FIT, & LEAN: Combined Workout and Nutrition Plan by Tim Cusick off trainingpeaks but would like it canceled and refunded please. The plan isn't at all what i expected it to be and has only 2 structured workouts each week (not the advertised 5) that can be synced with garmin or zwift. I thought it'd be like the first plan I bought from this coach's trainingpeaks library which I enjoyed so much.

Pls, can you issue a refund so I can get something else. The purchase was done today via paypal and this email address i'm mailing from is also my registered trainingpeaks address. Many thanks.

Kind regards,

Which plan??,"Hi! I am really keen to get back into running. In 2021 I ran three half marathons around 2.5hrs and a full marathon around 5 hrs but could have gone quicker without my training partner.

I have barely ran since 2022, but still quite active with walking.

I am a single mum so my days will need to be flexible for which day I train (e.g. move around what is set to suit my schedule).

Would love to get quicker and first step will be conquer 10km!

Which plan do you recommend please?

I see an issue in Training peaks, it assigns my first activity to a training, nevertheless I will start my training after the first activity.
So, let me explain in details:
On saturday, september the 7th, I performed a bike commute to the place where I train, so After finishing the commute, I started the training directly in My garmin device (it was my second bike activity on that day) so training peaks, assigned the first bike activitity to the planeed training, so 0% compliance with the planned training.
Look for opotio to reassign the planned training to the activity done I was not able to find.
yesterday (september the 10th) , I performed a test and it was confirmed : ""Training peaks assign the first activity to the planned training, eventhough at my garmin device I´m clearly strating the training at my second activity of the day"".
So, I need your helo on how to reassign an performed activity to the training planned.
Thanks a lot in advance,

Please let us all know (cc;d) when this is done and if we need to do anything else. You can remove the athletes under Scott's account from my account as well. If you need to confirm from this email address tpmain@nordicskilab.com, please just send an email and I will respond with a reply.

I hope that all makes sense. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Account termination,"Over the weekend (how convenient)  my bank account was assessed a renewal for 2024-25. While I am unable to rescind the payment and am stuck with the loss, I have closed my account (I actually had two). Please be advised you are NOT authorized to make any further assessments with respect to same. 
Your practices have resulted in my paying for a ""service"" I will not use for the next year. Please confirm my accounts are closed and you will not make any further attempts to collect fees for any year following this one.  Given you are being paid for a year I have terminated, this courtesy is a small one to provide.

Quitar entrenamientos programados.,"Buenos días, no se si es posible quitar los entrenamientos programados a un deportista de manera global. 

Me explico cuando un deportista cambia de entrenador al final se lleva toda la información de los entrenamientos programados, y luego me he dado cuenta que otros entrenadores me han copiado los entrenamientos. 

Me gustaría si fuera posible quitar los entrenamientos programados pero sin eliminar el entrenamiento realizado por el deportista. 

ES POSIBLE?
COMO SE PODRÍA HACER?

Muchas gracias por vuestra respuesta.

Own coaching environment,"Dear TrainingPeaks organization,

I would like to know how I can convert my current TP environment into my own coaching environment.
At the moment, this is paid for by the Dutch Triathlon Association. I work under the name: HeadcoachAlmere.

I would like to continue my work via TrainingPeaks, but in a personal capacity.
I work as a trainer-coach for the Triathlon Academy Almere. How can I do this?
Can I use this from October 1, 2024?

What is the price for this and are there any possibilities for a discount since it concerns talent development?
We have our own website (www.triathlonacademie.nl) and would like to mention TrainingPeaks as a partner, are you open to this?

Not sure if gamin workouts are syncing as expected.,"Maybe it's a UI misunderstanding, but I'm having trouble understanding how the Garmin/TP apps are working together. I selected a workout in the garmin app that was pushed by training peaks, but when it completes it looks like a different workout on the TP calendar/dashboard. For example: today (20/09/24) I selected the workout on my garmin that was named ""Zone 2 Aerobic Base Run or Hike 1hr"". All the instructions and everything seemed to line up. When I completed and saved it I now see a ""treadmill"" workout and the ""Zone 2 Aerobic Base Run or Hike 1hr"". There are no stats in the completed column of the workout that was added by my program (""Zone 2""). Can you clarify if this is a bug/settings/UI UX misunderstanding? 

If there is an issue, it probably stemmed from selecting the workout through my garmin calendar feature and not the workouts feature directly. If that's the case, is there a way to tell TP ""this garmin workout was actually this TP activity"". "

The first ride is from Kristen Gadson on 29th Sept 2024, 1hr9m most of the time in Z1 (81%) and 18% in Z2, yet a TSS of 50, which seems very high.

The second ride is one of mine on 23rd Aug 2024 where I spent 41% in Z1 and 55% in Z2, ride length 1hr7m TSS 44 which seems more accurate.

Hi Tony,

Thanks for the onboarding email and reaching out. Much appreciated.

I am all good from my end. I have used the premium athlete version for many years now so the coaching side of the platform is pretty self explanatory. I have just used the code this morning to waive the license fee and have gone with the basic $19/month package as I only have a handful of athletes I coach - Just enough to need them all in one place, but not enough for anything to fancy just yet. 

The ability to create plan and put them on the training peaks database for sale is a pretty neat feature which I will make use of. No expectations for sales but it is nice to have in the background on the off chance someone out there buys one.

If I need anything further I will let you know.

Have a great rest of the week and weekend ahead!

My original premium account would've expired on SEP23. This morning, my premium access was gone and I've lost access to functionality that I depend upon. I think this is because my original premium account would've expired and it has not transitioned to the premium account provided via Bulletproof, although I do see the Bulletproof logo on my dashboard page. It's probably just a clerical glitch, but could you please help me get my premium access turned on once again? I'll also send a message to Coach Maclean.  Thank you!

I'm doing the 26 week mountain climbing course and I'm having some trouble logging workouts.

I use a Garmin 955 Solar.

When I go to Schedule Workouts on my Garmin I can see all the Training Peaks workouts loaded up, however when I click through to do a workout there is no option for incline treadmill or stair machine. So when i chose another format of workout, say run, it doesn't recognize I'm doing a much harder workout (i.e climbing 200 floors). For example this morning, I did 75 minutes on the stair machine and it only registered a TSS of 3. What's the best way to Training Peaks to understand I'm doing a much harder workout?

Hello Sarah, 

 

This is interesting as the discount is valid. I looked at this athlete's account, and they recently used another discount code to purchase Premium.  The only restriction is that an athlete can not use the code twice in one calendar year. If anyone continues to have issues with this, I would direct them to our support team as they will be able to track this issue and be the quickest response for the member- support@trainingpeaks.com 

 

Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing.

Thanks for looking into it! Can you just check the code again for me as we have had this issue a few times from other members?

 

Would you like me to continue to direct any queries to yourself or if the code is definitely working and it’s an issue on their TP account to direct them to someone in TP customer service?

 

Perhaps if you can provide us with a list of FAQ’s Why my code might not work / things to check?

 

Let me know your thoughts!

Hello Sarah, 

 

I am sorry about this, as this seems to be becoming more and more frequent. I took a look at this account and it looks like they purchased Premium today and used another discount code. I am not sure if this is because the BT code was not working, but it will not allow them to purchase two subscriptions with two discount codes.  Really, the only regulation around the code usage is it can only be used once per user, and it will now allow them to stack discount codes.

Re: TSS and rTss,"Hey Training Peaks,


Can you take a look at Brian's account and see why his run workouts are all super high in his rTSS? He seems to be staying in his zones, but he is getting really high rankings. The swim and cycling workouts look good.


Thank you.

Hey Brian,


How did these workouts feel, did they feel like you were over working for the goal of the workout? It is important to know that we do not build our workouts off the rTSS, that is a TP metric that we do not use when building our plans.


Thank you.

This is Sundays run ….. that rTSS looks weird to me.  How is it so high . As well as the iF score ?? I’ve not done it yet but it wouldn’t be more than 120 I would assume ?? Seems like there’s something in the background skewing the numbers ?

Workouts not syncing,"Hi

I can't see my workouts for the last month in WKO5. I have my own account. I recently ended the coaching with Hamish Ferguson because he drove me into a massive hole. Sick for 7 weeks, I am very lucky I have started to come out of it.  I had no menstrual periods for 6 months. He thrashed me in every workout and expected me to do 5 hours on weekdays when I work full time.  He didnt listen to feedback from me. Very poor communication. Never adjusted my training when I asked. But happy to compare me with other riders in a critical way when it suited him. Even though I am current master world champion x 3. An awful coaching experience. He had WKO5. I dont know if he has tried to access my TP or has deleted my workouts from WKO5. I dont trust him.  He is not trustworthy and does not look after athletes wellbeing. Someone keeps trying to access my TP, so I have changed the password. I suspect its him. Very strange person. I am a medical doctor and I suspect he has a ? learning disability? a personality disorder and a mental illness. When I asked for feedback on my workout and to adjust my training as I was feeling flogged, instead he would not answer my query but text back weird personal things about himself or how well another rider is going which is highly inappropriate and unprofessional. Disturbing.  Anyway, can you please sync my TP to WKO5 for me. I cant seem to get it to work. My TP username is pennypawson and password is Phoenix. Also part of my reason for sharing is that if people ask for recommendations for coaches in NZ, I recommend against Hamish Ferguson- you need to put a red flag against his name. This man is going to really harm an athlete some day."

I have couple of feature suggestions for consideration.

1.  Follow up flag - In the mobile app add a facility to flag notifications for follow up; for comments, workouts etc.  Why? Because often when I, and other coaches I speak to, am out or travelling I can’t always answer the athlete but want to come back to it. Follow up flag would be really helpful.
2. Voice feedback - ability to add voice feedback in both mobile and browser version.  Like in WhatsApp for example you can record in the app or attach a recording from the iPhone.  Also to voice notes to sessions description and pre-activity comments to add specifics personal to the athlete to complement written session info. Why?  Because I’m dyslexic and typing is much more difficult, and time consuming, than speaking.  Also I think it can be a really nice way get get a message across. 

Thanks

USAC Discount,"Good morning, 
I recently finished USAC Level 3 Certification. It is advertised that there is a 20% discount for TP, but there is no code anywhere on their website. Is this still applicable? If so, how do I apply it? (My 2 week premium trial ended, and I am about to purchase an annual membership. I am also a new coach at Hardin-Simmons University and will be adding athletes soon). The 20% discount would help out a lot, and I wanted to wait to purchase until I found out if this is available. Thanks for your help.

Workouts disappear later in the day. ,"Hi There, 
I have an issues with workouts that are downloaded to a wahoo Roam. They download just fine but if I chooses to do the workout later in the day, say 8PM, the workouts automatically disappear from both the Wahoo App and from the Bolt. This happens regardless of the time I download the workout. If I do not download the workout until later in the day, say 8PM or later, the workout will just not download from training peaks at all. 
Thanks for any help you can offer:)"

I am a personal trainer and going through my running coach qualification. I currently use a different platform but I am thinking of moving across to training peaks too. The only issue I am having is being able to download the training plans into a PDF format or print them. is this something i can do? I have tried to print from my browser, but I cannot see the calendar. I have some clients who do not use apps as they are a little older and they would need a plan sent by email or printed out. I was also a little confused regarding the pricing structure. as you can imagine this would be very time consuming so i want to get it right. I am also wondering if you send out welcome emails where i ca attach my own PDF with my own welcome email and any health forms for them to fill out? I don't see there is an option to message them through this app either? It would be great if you can help.

Dear TrainingPeaks Team,

I have been working as a coach in cycling for many years, and for several years now, I have been using TrainingPeaks and WKO5. I lead a sports academy with young talents in cycling and 16 other sports. We are receiving increasing inquiries from cyclists, cross-country skiers, triathletes, rowers, etc., regarding our training planning and analysis services.

 

My question is: Does TrainingPeaks provide any informational materials, such as PowerPoint presentations, graphics, descriptions, or Best Practice examples, outside of your online marketing efforts for users of your planning and analysis tools? These materials would be useful for teaching in sports classes.

 

Thank you very much for your excellent work and the continuous development of your systems and tools.

I have two questions hope you can help me with 
1- on planned and completed activities
when I have activities coming from garmin, they pair (either automatically or manually)
and then the activity is display on a different color. like completed. 
but what about other activities that wont have a garmin input. Meditation, stretching, etc. 
I dont find a way to mark the activity as completed, and then see anything pending 

2- on garmin sync
garmin syncs work great, for normal activities like indoor cycling, road cycling, etc. 
but when the activity is ""motocross"", it wont sync. 
my coach cant see my data from either races or training sessions. super important 
this is a valid activity on garmin.
attaching screenshots. 

3- on automatic pairing
what does TP uses to try to match planned activity vs garmin activity? 
is it type? scheduled time? 
when they dont pair, I found the way to manually pair. 
but if I know what parameters use TP to try to pair, maybe I can configure the activities better so they pair automatically more often (now almost never) 

thank guys. 
looking forward for your input

Zwift,"Dear TP Support Team,
I have two questions:
1 - I have Zwift connected to TP: why the activities from zwift do not show 1 km lap information in TP?
2 - I have two running activities on Sep. 19, 2024 that represent the same workout on a treadmill. (Zwift connected to treadmill and Garmin watch, recorded both in TP and Garmin Connect.) In TP, I have the two activities:  (please be free to check my activities on Sep. 19, 2024)
a) transferred from zwift: TSS = 61/124 rTSS/hrTSS - reports an elevation gain of 358 m 
b) transferred from Garmin Connect: TSS = 99/93 rTSS/hrTSS - no elevation gain reported.
In Garmin Connect they have a load of  264/265.
Why the TSS difference between the two activities? The one recording the elevation gain has a lower TSS. Why?

Thank you.
Best,
Ricardo

Hello Stephanie and Dominic,

I wanted to clarify things on my end, my apologies for any confusion. I signed up for a new basic training peaks account on 9/3, I then signed up for premium on 9/6, and lastly was refunded premium on 9/9 and placed back to a basic account.

Thank you for your time!

Hi Dominic and Stacey,
I noticed that Stacey has a basic TP account and I've not been able to upgrade her account to premium. Stacey mentioned that she already had a premium TP account before she started with CTS, but has cancelled that and was told CTS would upgrade the account. I'm trying to figure out how to do this, but I don't see the option. Can you point us in the right direction?

Thank you!

Yesterday I purchased a monthly subscription for your service and connected my Garmin connect and made it import the last five years of days, but I then realized that I wanted to subscribe for a whole year. I couldn't see an upgrade button (from monthly to yearly) so I cancelled my monthly subscription and next month I am just going to sign up for a whole year. Two questions from all of this:
1. Has this stopped the Garmin connect import? I know there can be a delay for up to 24 hours
2. Will I lose anything when my monthly subscription stops and I resign up for yearly?"

Help using traning peaks for research,"Hello,

My name is Flávia, I'm currently with the 7-day coach free trial, but I'm not actually a coach I'm a researcher from Brazil. From what I've seen the platform is amazing for what a need but I have two issues that may prevent this from working out for me, and I would like to know if there is anything that you could do for me.

First, since I'll be working with possibly thousands of people, during a two year follow up, extracting data one by one would be very difficult. Is there a way that I could have the results from all my athletes at once, say, once a week? If not from the platform itself maybe as an internal process?

Second, since english is not our first language and this is for a research I would need at least some of the information to be in portuguese, I'm particularly interested in the metrics questions. Is there a way to include custom questions so I could enter them in portuguese, since there isnt a brazilian version of the app?

I understand if these are not possible but I had to ask because it would be really helpfull.
Thanks in advance
Cheers,

Flávia"

Sesión de fuerza,"Hola 
Cuando uso el nuevo modelo para hacer una sesión de fuerza y creo un ejercicio nuevo con un vídeo mío que me he grabado, lo subo a Vimeo y se ve con el ordenador y todo funciona perfectamente.
Pero cuando lo abres con el móvil, en el ejercicio que yo he diseñado con el enlace de Vimeo público no se puede ver, se ve en blanco.
Como mis atletas van a entrenar al gym con el móvil no con el ordenador pues no pueden ver los ejercicios que yo he subido.
Esto os pasa a vosotros? Yo tengo un redmi note 13, no sé si es por el móvil, pero les pasa también a mis clientes que tienen otros modelos "
Polar flow connect ,"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,
ich hatte meine polar App mit der Training peaks app immer gekoppelt, was auch gut funktioniert hat. Seit ein paar Tagen werden nun aber die Einheiten nicht mehr auf Training peaks hochgeladen, obwohl ich nichts in den Einstellungen geändert habe. Ich habe es nun schon einige Male versucht, die apps bei zu verknüpfen. Mir wird die Verbindung auch angezeigt, aber die Einheiten von Polar werden nicht auf Training peaks hochgeladen. Ich bitte dabei um Unterstützung, da ich auf Training peaks einen Trainer habe und bezahle, und diesen Service auch entsprechend in Anspruch nehmen können möchte. 

Vielen Dank für Ihre Unterstützung!

"Re: Welcome to TrainingPeaks,  Daniela!","Good evening, 
I just purchased the program for Running coach, initially my account was linked to another coach but now I would like to have my profile as a coach. if I try to enter my application it seems that the athlete profile has remained and if I go to the site I can't understand with which credentials I can access as a coach.

I want to know how to avoid Training Peaks associa...,"I want to know how to avoid Training Peaks associating a warm up or cooldown run as my scheduled workout. 

When I hit RUN on my Garmin device, it suggests the scheduled workout. I hit Skip as I want to warm up, for instante. After I finish my warm up, when I go to find my scheduled run, its not showing up anymore. Training Peaks thinks my open run/warm up is the scheduled Workout. 

Another similar case is when I cooldown. After i finish my scheduled workout, i Hit end and SAVE. I then followup by hitting RUN activity as an open workout. By open I mean no goal pace or distance.

After both workouts upload to my TP, the last run (the Cooldown) is associated with my run and the first run (which is in fact the run I did per the scheduled workout instructions) is uploaded as a ""stray"" workout/run.

Take a look at my run today, for instance. I did not want to run my Cooldown within my scheduled run as I like to keep my workout and cooldown data separate. However, when they uploaded to TP, the COOLDOWN was associated as my workout, which clearly it is completely off. I have to go online and unpair/pair the workouts to clean this up. Its sort of a pain.

Is there anyway this bug can be corrected? I repeat: I hit SKIP to avoid GARMIN from associating my open run as a scheduled TP workout.

It is an extra cost for me for more than 250 dollar pr month, and also additional for every single athletes I bring in.

Is there any programs you can offer for me who have more than 30 athletes?

Can you please check it from your side, so that the premium version ends with 29th September 2024 and I will not be charged for another year for now? If I start again with a proper training, then I will rejoin the Premium version again; I really liked it :)

TrainingPeaks iOS App,"How frequently is TrainingPeaks updating the data in the calendar feed?

I changed the time of a training session. I subscribe to my calendar via iOS calendars. After one hour, the session time in my iOS calendar has not changed. I unsubscribed from the calendar and resubscribed, but the session time is still not matching the new time.

User story - my coach plans the training for a day, and the time appears in my calendar as 0:00.
In the morning I review my day and change the time in iOS app to match my availability. The initial time change syncs promptly to the iOS calendar. If my availability changes, I update the time in the iOS app, but the change is not getting updated in iOS calendar."

Nutritionist coach,"Hi 

I hope alls well

I am a performance nutritionist & work alongside athletes/coaches utilising TP. What id like to do as their nutritionist is add comments to their planned workouts to suggest pre/peri/post nutrition strategies to support their session. 

Would this require premium athlete accounts, or can I do that with basic athlete accounts? The athlete I assume would just add me as an additional coach.

Re: Billing update failure,"This is a follow-up to your previous request #805660 ""Billing update failure""
Hi Kristina,

I checked with the bank and they gave me a new card, however the trainingpeaks Platform still does not allow me to update the payment method.

I made sure that everything on the bank's side is correct, and I followed the recommendations that you give on the help page, with no positive change.

At this point I think that the only solution left for me is to delete the account and buy a new one, which means creating my training library from scratch, migrating all the athletes on the account and trying to make sure that this account change does not impact the activities and training of the club that I manage.

Currently this account has the new strengthening function, I am a little worried about having to lose that too.

I hope you can help me not to lose all the work and effort put into that account, however if it is necessary to close the account and open a new one I will do so...

Greetings and thank you very much in advance for your help."

Your coach has replied. To respond, please reply to this email.

Hi Bernie
 
Thank for you email. I'm responding on behalf of Phil so I hope that's ok. I can see that you bought Phil's Advanced Full Distance Triathlon 48 Week Plan on Saturday. 
 
This is the highest volume plan we have, so I can understand why you feel it will be a struggle to fit into your schedule, especially with 3 young children to also factor in!
 
It's no problem to refund you, but to facilitate the refund, you will need to contact TrainingPeaks (https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) .
 
I am sorry that I cannot process this refund for you myself - this is because TrainingPeaks own the online store and manage all transactions. If they need authorisation, please forward their reply to us so we can confirm. 
 
Alternatively, we would be happy to switch your plan for free before 28th September 2024 to an alternative that better suits your race goals and training availability. If this is of interest, please let me have your race date, distance and an indication of your available training time and I I will be happy to make a recommendation. However, I fully understand if you would prefer to request a refund.
 
Just let me know if I can help further.

Hi Phil,

I purchased your Ironman plan a couple of days ago and it was my plan to start it in a few weeks however, I had a quick look at the weekly plans and I am very sorry but I did not realize the amount of training volume  - particularly the amount of long training sessions for the bike. I am a single Mum of 3 kids and thought I would fit in sessions in the early mornings but I'm afraid there are too many long sessions , there is no way I will manage this. So if it is ok I would really like to ask for a refund please. 

Many thanks

I’ve signed up for my first Ironman 70.3 and I’m searching for the right plan for me. I’ve never done a triathlon/ironman before so combining all the skills will be new to me. I have a pretty busy schedule with work and family so it’s concerning trying to fit all the required training in… as for training, i am a comfortable runner (5K, 10Ks) and I enjoy the biking. I haven’t been in the water in quite a few years, that would be my biggest weakness. 
I’m pretty set on getting a 24Week plan but I’m undecided on whether to get the beginner or intermediate plan. I’m dedicated to setting aside the time for training, I have a Wahoo trainer and treadmill for indoor training. 
Im stoked to hear back! Thanks!"

"Thank you, Coach","Hello, this is Yasmine Adel. I have both a premium athlete as well as a coach account. 

I am reaching out as I wanted to ask you about the 'Thank you, coach' submission. I have submitted a story praising my former coach and wanted to ask you how it works. Would he be notified of my submission or will TP post something on social media?

I am asking because (to the reader- dont laugh!) I am in love with my coach. Madly, helplessly, painfully in love with him. Couldnt really write that in my submission. Coaches could sometimes have this effect, I guess! He started coaching me back in 2021 and I fell helplessly in love with him. I had to end the coaching unfortunately as I could not manage the professional aspect of being trained by him while I was swimming amid all these feelings. I used to use the comments section almost as a diary and romance journal.. trying to figurately tell him my feelings. So I decided to study sport science myself, self coach and coach some juniors. But till this day and despite that our communication is poor and scarse, he is the love of my life. I sent that submission but now wondering what he will be receiving from TP.

Thank you TP... and wish me luck, whoever reads this! I hope he sees me one day <3 "

The subscription is already canceled for the following month but I would like it to be canceled now and the amount that I have retained in the account returned to me since I do not want your premium subscription. 

I hope this situation is resolved as soon as possible. My username is Jrrysx and my email es garciacubasjorge@gmail.com.

Thank you and greetings."

Dynamic Training Plans - TrainingPeaks Support ,"Hello Phil and Total Tri Training,

My name is Henry, and I’m with the TrainingPeaks Customer Support Team. I’m reaching out regarding your Dynamic Training Plans. We’ve had a few reports from users indicating that some of these plans are showing up on their athletes’ calendars, and we’d really appreciate your help in resolving this.

To assist you in identifying these plans, I’ve attached a screenshot below that shows two entries from one of your plans on an athlete’s calendar. We want to ensure that these plans are removed from any athletes who no longer need them, and your support in pinpointing the exact plan would be extremely helpful.

Thank you in advance for your assistance, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. We really appreciate your partnership in resolving this.

Looking forward to hearing from you!"

I have been working as a coach in cycling for many years, and for several years now, I have been using TrainingPeaks and WKO5. I lead a sports academy with young talents in cycling and 16 other sports. We are receiving increasing inquiries from cyclists, cross-country skiers, triathletes, rowers, etc., regarding our training planning and analysis services.

My question is: Does TrainingPeaks provide any informational materials, such as PowerPoint presentations, graphics, descriptions, or Best Practice examples, outside of your online marketing efforts for users of your planning and analysis tools? These materials would be useful for teaching in sports classes.

Thank you very much for your excellent work and the continuous development of your systems and tools.

Payment Issue for Coach Account on TrainingPeaks,"Dear TrainingPeaks Support,
I previously had an athlete account with TrainingPeaks, which I was able to pay for smoothly using PayPal. Some time ago, I was invited to a Zoom meeting to receive support, during which I expressed my interest in transitioning to a coach account. However, I encountered an issue: PayPal is not available as a payment option for coach accounts. As a result, I have not been able to use TrainingPeaks for the past year.
At the time, I was assured that this issue would be resolved, but I have recently discovered that nothing has changed. As a Dutch user without a credit card—and with no intention of obtaining one—I am concerned that I might no longer be able to use TrainingPeaks.
Could you please inform me if there are any alternative payment options available? I would very much like to continue using your platform.
Thank you for your time and assistance.
Best regards,

If not possible, if you could delete my coach account so I can create a new one with a different username.

If you can change it, something like hichamb or coach.hicham would be good!

Hello, I recently purchased the ""beginner"" mountaineering program. I haven't started it yet, i was wondering if i wanted to switch to the intermediate or the comprehensive plan would you credit the $48 towards one of them? 

Also, i upgraded to the premium plan on Training Peaks but forgot to use the ""UphillAthlete2024"" code for 20% off. Would you be willing to apply that retroactively? 

Thank you,

Fitbit app miscommunication,"I am particularly proud of my Day 1, Aerobic Threshold Test. If there is a way to import this into Training Peaks, I would be quite pleased!

On Training Peaks, I have found ""Fitbit"" under other apps. It asked me what I would like to sync (weight, heart rate, distance), I clicked all of it. It now says I am connected to a Fitbit through my Google account. Furthermore, when I did the AtT, I recorded the exercise with my Fitbit ""Exercise>Treadmill"", which was accurately recorded in the Fitbit app. (I have just downloaded the data, so perhaps I will be able to send it along). I opened Training Peaks after, it said a workout was uploaded, or something to the effect. Under the day, it had a newly added ""run"" activity with no data in it. I have since populated the ""Indoor test"" tab with the data I got off of FitBit: ""distance"", calories, average HR, etc. 

Today I will start up Day 2. I'll try ""Record Event"" under Training Peaks, along with the usual record activity with the Fitbit, to see if that helps. 

Any advice? I feel I'll probably miss some useful metrics, like HR drift, if I don't upload the test results.

Peak performances in Training peaks,"To Whom it may concern 


I’ve noticed over quite some time that as a coach I see  with some of my Premium TP clients the alert after a session “Peak performances”.
When I go in to look it will have medials for PB (duration) for the last 90 days and or PB medal (for a stipulated duration) “All time”. 

Yet when I go and look how they stack up to their historical data the Value doesn’t necessarily even fall within their top 20 PB of all time…. 


This is quite confusing as a coach and for athletes as it gives an inaccurate sense of comparison to uploaded historical data…. 



Have you got some advice/an explanation on this for me as it’s happened with numerous clients I work with.
I’d really appreciate your feedback on this, 

Kind regards

Extrem GPR & GPA values in WKO5,"Dear WKO service team,

I need your help with my GPR & GPA values. There seems to be an issue with some of my data and I think this is a hardware problem of my Garmin Rally RS200 pedals, which I bought this march. But there response was, that they can't use data of a third party as a reference. Which was not very satisfactory. I would like to know from you guys, if you think it is a hardware or software problem. Or maybe I don't understand something here.

On a few rides, (not every ride!) I get like 24.000W GPR right and sometimes left. Sometimes more, sometimes less W but its always a very high number for 1sek. The same goes for GPA. I attach you the .fit file from a example workout and a few pictures from WKO5. I'll also attach the .csv export of example, were i marked the exact time of the data spike in yellow. It occurred after 30:08 minutes, which is in row 1406.

Please let me know what you think.

Best regards

Maxi"

I've started the 8 weeks faster freeestyle course with effortless switching and was pleased to see that the workouts sync with TP and I presume connected devices.

The workouts appear in TP, but I cannot get them to sync over to my watch (Fenix 6).

My watch is connected to TP fot sure.  It worked flawlessly in the past for run and bike workouts but swim workouts were not sync'able.  Perhaps now they are?  It gets from my watch some vital metrics (HR, body battery etc) each day so I know the connection is live and working.

When I go into the TP swim workout, in the top right hand corner of the workout details section there is a graphic of a watch, but its unbranded.  Clicking on this says ""new connection"". In the past it used to show a garmin graphic but now I work back over past sync'ed workouts I can see they are all unbranded suggesting something has changed. 

When I go to my watch and sync, nothing comes across.  My watch tells me to download my training calendar which I throught was done by simply sync'ing.  

Any advice greatly appreciated."

Strength and conditioning sessions ,"Hi, will there be a feature to upload your own exercise video tutorials in the workout builder for strength sessions instead of using training peaks video library?.Also to be able to track specific exercise progressions over weeks/months e.g barbell squat on a graph to see progress would be great. 
Let me know if these will be included in the future as I know several other apps specifically on the personal training side of things include these and I feel its one area that would really benefit my service if training peaks included some of these features. 
Look forward to hearing your response.

Hey Hannah, I apologize for this issue... 

First, I'd suggest confirming that all of the card information is correctly entered and the zip code associated with the card matches your bank's information. You might also contact your bank's tier-two support team to confirm they aren't blocking the payment (and make the payment with them on the phone). Sometimes banks will place an inadvertent hold on certain bills as potential fraud protection, especially for international transactions. It's always recommended to confirm with them that they will allow bills from TrainingPeaks to be processed.
Another option will be to clear the ""cookies and cache"" and give it a try once again.
Let me know if you continue to have issues,

Help us make the most of your time:  Tell us about your business and goals for the call
I'm starting my second year as head coach for the triathlon team at a small private school. I already use TP as an athlete and have for years but would like to implement it for my team. We're a nonprofit (I have documentation) and customer service let me know earlier in the year that would give us a 50% discount, so I'd like to discuss the different options there. I would also love to get a basic overview of programming. I plan to do the same programming for the whole team but will sometimes want to add A, B and C workouts. If I program far in advance but decide my athletes need a week off, can I shift training sessions back a week all at once? I've noticed the recent updates have my sessions uploading twice (can explain more on the call). How do I troubleshoot that? I'm sure I'll come up with more questions but that's it for now...thank you!"
Integration to tindeq progressor,"Hi guys wondering if you'd consider integration with tindeq amd there progressor. It's a finger strength training tool used for climbing a d other sports. They have some really nice output in the app abd I reckon an integration would be really neat. 
I currently output my climbing workouts, bouldering indoor Climbing via my garmin integration but the data into training peaks isn't as rich as garmin. I use rpe tss and fatigue charts, but would love to be able to identify peaks for climbing also. 
I reckon that you can only adopt what garmin or third party present for the workouts but it's hard to have a single pane to manage the workouts and use my various training tools whether that's my concept2 rower / garmin (for climbing workputs) or tindeq progressor. 

Appreciate if you could consider some improvements on your side in these areas.

Kind regards

And now it isn't working and I can't even connect it with my trainingpeaks anymore. 1 thing is sure, the card that now at this moment is connected with my account (ending 7317) is not able to do the payments, because this card is not the card of my profession.

Betreff: Re: TrainingPeaks / Karsten
Hi Karsten,
 
The coaching account is not free, but the basic athlete accounts are.
 
There's a $99 start fee, but with the code ""TPCOACH"" this fee will be waived. The $19 plan (per month) includes 4 basic athletes and 1 premium for free. You can have more athletes within this plan, but they would have to become premium with an additional cost of $9 per athlete, unless your athlete already has his/her premium account, then you will not have any additional charges.  The $49 plan (per month) includes UNLIMITED basic athletes and 1 premium for free. Same here, you can still add extra athletes (premium) for $9 per month.
 
So it all depends whether you want your athletes on premium or basic, you can find the differences here: https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204074014-Basic-vs-Premium-Athlete-Accounts Check out this link for more info: https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204072544-TrainingPeaks-Coach-Account-Pricing-and-Billing

Good Morning Tony,
 
thank you very much for your email ...
 
Some words to my person, I`m a certified (B-level) cycling coach and working as a trainer for the local cycling club since many years now. (this is absolutely on an voluntary base)
Actually one of our young MTB cyclist had been nominated to the cadre and asked for coaching.
Since the german ""BDR"" is using Trainingspeaks (I realized that there is a kind of co-operation ?!), he did sent my the invitation link.
 
While using other systems in the past, I understood that this sevice is basically not for free.
My free trail version will end at the14th of march & in case I decide to continue my fee would be 19$/months for the same level of service as of today ... ?!

Annual Training Plan Adjustments,"Not sure if this has been brought up or not, but over the years I've always found it frustrating that if I were to modify an athlete's ATP and hit save- it would not only change the future of that ATP (which is the goal), but it would also recalculate previous blocks of the plan...the blocks/weeks that have already been completed. 

Is there a way to modify the ATP process so that when adjusting for new/updated race dates, it only adjusts future blocks?

100 mile gravel race by Karen Mead,"Plan described and listed as a “structured” plan but you have to manually work through the intervals.

I’ve used training peaks for over 5 years and have participated in many races and have an entire library of plans that I’ve spent good money on.  This plan is useless!"

refund for 14-WEEK ICE & MIXED CLIMBING PLAN,"Hello! Could I have a refund for this training plan?

I am a premium member and have purchased a few training plans, all of which I have liked. This plan has extremely limited information to the point that I might as well be doing it self directed. Here is an example of particularly sparse workout section:

====
-HANGING SCAPULA RETRACTION. Use as narrow or wide grip as you feel comfortable; most find hands a bit wider than shoulder width to be the best. Assist by placing feet on the floor or box and/or wear a climbing harness with elastic band(s) attached to the belay loop pulling in an upward direction.
https://youtu.be/o-G2IIJkx8U
-2-LEGGED SQUAT. Either hold weight in hands, wear a weighted pack or vest or with a barbell on your back or front.
-2-LEGGED DEADLIFT. Either hold weight in hands, using a hex bar, or with a barbell.
===
How many scapula retractions should I be doing? Weight? Sets?
What about squat and deadlift? Some of the workouts say 1 less than 1Rep max, but others have almost no information. Sorry to be a pain, but it was $75.

My Garmin and Zwift are connected as of yesterday, and it is now updating, so I know that it works. I have requested that it provide the five-year history from Garmin, but nothing has happened so far (about 24 hours). Since I am impatient, I disconnected and reconnected when it did not occur immediately, which I now understand I should not have done. I did have another TP account with a different login just before I found a login for this account, so I disconnected that one and upgraded this since I have historical data on this account. How do we get Garmin to start sending over the stored data? Kind regards

The scenario: I used the ErgDate app for my PM5 monitors on my Concept 2 rowing and ski ergs.  I also turn on my garmin watch. I use the same Polar heartrate strap to supply heartrate information to both devices. But when the exercises upload to Training Peaks, they receive vastly different ratings. Please help me understand this. I try to go back and delete the watch files, so I don't have duplicates, but I use my watch so that my garmin ""body battery"" gets the full picture. Anyway, please help me better understand what is happening here and which is the more accurate data. 

I have  attached two such files.

Biosensors for Continuous Glucose Monitoring,"Are there any plans to connect to the apps being used by Dexcom Stelo or Freestyle Lingo for Glucose monitoring, now FDA approved for non-prescription? These companies can now cash in on a huge boom in data driven athletes in the US. If you have any plans to build integration that could change which one I Purchase. The apps currently integrate with Apple health app. Of course these companies are huge and may not work with you even though your company is now huge compare to when I first subscripted about 14 yrs ago.

Also I have an Oura ring which does not connect with TP but its competitor Whoop does, are there any plans to build integration there? Oura also connects with apple health app but the useful HRV and SPO2 do not move across to TP.

Android bugs that keep popping up,"I have 3 bugs I keep experiencing. I'm on a Google Pixel 7 on Android 14. I've also experienced this on Android 13.

1. The calendar view on the dashboard will be ""shifted"" - i.e. the first day becomes Wednesday but when I tap it, it shows me Monday's workouts. This one's pretty weird. It usually sticks around for days at a time and is not corrected by a hard-close. 

2. Today's Workouts often doesn't show planned workouts and will instead show ""No workouts today"". Usually if I close the app and open it again, it corrects. In the screenshot, it shows my ride I did but it doesn't show my planned swim. Before the bike, it said ""No workouts today"".

I start the plan on the Garmin but it does not the give me the option to use a stairmaster, only hike, indoor run etc. When I sync the Garmin to TP afterwards it shows up on the calendar as a Grey separate workout instead of the programmed workout. Any ideas how to create stairmaster as an option for the workout in the calendar/ programmed workouts and to sync as a single event on the calendar? The strength programmed workouts sync without problems using the same plan and the Garmin. Thanks, James

Cancel accounts,"Hello, I've had both athlete and a coach account for many years but no longer use them and want to cancel.

My accounts all used my ""mtb2die@comcast.net"" email address.

It's very annoying, can we figure out why it's doing this?

Inquiry About Membership Model and Partnership Opportunities,"Hi,

We’ve been working with TrainingPeaks for many years, offering online coaching for trail running and pre-prepared training plans to our customers. We’ve now reached a milestone of approximately 100 runners across 35 countries in our coaching programs, along with a significant number of training plan sales.

As we continue to grow, we’re looking to elevate our offerings with a new membership model. Since we already have a solid library of training plans, I have a few questions about how this could work with TrainingPeaks:

* Is it possible to share a complete library of training plans from the Arduua account with customers who have a Basic TrainingPeaks account?
* Is it possible to share a full library of workouts with customers who have a Premium TrainingPeaks account, allowing them to plan their own training?

Additionally, I’d love to discuss opportunities for a deeper partnership with TrainingPeaks. We’re interested in exploring better pricing or discounts on Premium accounts (if we purchase these accounts for our runners), which could help both of us grow in this area.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Katinka

Payments not going through,"Hi, 
As per emails I sent earlier, subscription payments aren't going through despite having sufficient funds in the account, also checked with security settings and called the bank. Later during the day tried adding/updating card details (two different cards) which took me to authorizing $1 transactions twice on each one of them with a one time password sent by the bank to approve the charge, which I did, however, no luck with that too, as transaction never hit my account/s. The account which is linked to Training Peaks is same account since, I started in November 2023. 
There are some new guidelines by Reserve Bank Of India which have restricted subscription payments and have a mandate for the banks across India (I am sure your accounts team may have come across this issue with other in India, sharing this link for you to get some insight on this, so we can have a work around to this issue

user data collection - trained athlete ,"I have a trainee to whom I have been planning since I have been using TP as a platform (more than 5 years to date) and who recently wanted to cancel his premium membership and become a basic user; when he did so, his account was cancelled. 
his email is jsanchezviamonte@gmail.com and his deleted user is “jsanchezviamonte” (now he had to open a new one “Jsv1976”). 
the inconvenience is not the deletion of the user but of the record of the planned and completed calendar that has been deleted too! 
he made a claim to request the transfer of his old user data to the new one, in order to be able to deal with the histrial of plans configured by me as a trainer! the answer was negative, alleging (I quote from the text) ""Your coach is not planning any workouts on your Training Peaks calendar. Only completed workouts are being uploaded from the device you complete them on. I am unsure of your request here.""
As a trainer I have been planning for years in the calendar of each and every one of my trainees, and what they complete are my structured plans and mounted on the TP platform, 
So my query would be as follows:  
1º if this information is feasible to recover as visible as it was planned by me as a trainer to continue to have available my work for years. Either recovering the deleted account or migrating the data to the new account that has been generated by the same and that is also linked to me as a trainer?
2º if migrating the information as well as reactivating your deleted user is not possible; how can I as a coach access the calendar information of your deleted user in order to see my work, I request this since in that information there are many hours of professional dedication (in structuring and making microcycles, seasons, stages of your plans) that today mean hours of new dedication that should not be implemented since the information should be in backup for my account as a coach! 
I hope I have been clear enough in the explanation, at disposal and waiting to recover my work of years on my trained!

RE: Bloqueo de cuenta,"Hola! Mi nombre es Jerónimo, estoy con ustedes 8 meses como entrenador, ayer tuve una videollamada por Zoom con Toni Baca, muy amable él, y le comenté mi caso.

Comenté que en junio tuve el mismo problema que tenía a todos los atletas como función premium ""herramienta que no he utilizado"", me llamó un compañero, creo que Gabriel, se lo comenté y no me puso ninguna pega y me paso a una cuenta básica, que es la que cogí desde que entré en enero, me dijo que estaba todo ok y se me cobró la cuota de cuenta básica y que habían modificado todo. Cuando entro ahora en septiembre veo que tengo la cuenta bloqueado y factura de casi 365 euros y todos premium.

Creo que el compañero se le olvidaría cambiar el plan de todos ellos, porque yo no lo he utilizado nunca, los acabo de poner en básico como me dijo Toni y he puesto una tarjeta para que se me cobre la cuota de 49$ de cuenta básica.

SI puede ser a la mayor brevedad posible, porque necesito programar las siguientes semanas.

Hope all is well! I have just changed my subscription to coach edition unlimited as I now have 5 athletes. I just wanted to make sure they had added themselves correctly as some of them have a red circle around their photo, and also I've had this notification below? I haven't added myself as the premium athlete yet, but assume I still can?



Hope that makes sense

Hi Leanne, 

Absolutely! go ahead and link yourself as an athlete to be able to test things out or even ""coach yourself"". Then, add athletes in there since your plan includes 4 basic athletes and 1 premium for free (which can be yourself).

Let me know if anything else comes up please!

I want a platform that is easy for run clients to use and has detailed and diverse strength training programming as well.

One of our coaches (Norrie Hay) had sent a link to an athlete (Nynke Mulholland) to be assigned to his licence. She said she followed through on the process / set up an account – but she never came across online.

 

Norrie then tried to add her manually – but the system said an account for that name already existed (so prevented the manual addition).

 

Can you see her on the system / is there a reason it didn’t link up? If you can’t link it up – I’ll ask them to redo the process or I’ll send a link to the main account and transfer it across that way.

 

Hope all is good at your end and hopefully I won’t be bothering you too much…!

 

Cheers for now,

 

Mark

Hi Tim,

 

Sorry – I’m emailing to see if we can make another change please?

 

I’d like to change SALCOACH21 (Michael Wright) to SALCOACH22 if that is possible and change the email to the below?

Let me know if you need any more information (and I can update the password as well at the right time).

Hi Tim,

 

From what I am reading…do you need to change the username and I then do the password?

 

Ideally could we change it to SALCOACH21 please (and I’ll change the password to the same).

Mark, sorry for the delay. I've switched out Derek's information for Michael's. All you have to do is reset the password and username if you'd like.

 

Let me know if you need a spot anywhere.

Change Monthly plan to Annual ,"Hi Team,

I've recently started using TrainingPeaks again after intermittent use. I’ve canceled some other subscriptions and can now afford to invest in this platform, which better aligns with my training plan. I initially opted for the monthly plan to test the waters and quickly realized the value. Now, I’d like to switch to the annual plan, as a friend and influencer shared his subscription code 'VCTRI', which will save me more money in the long run.

However, I wasn't able to find the steps to make this switch in your knowledge base or forums. I even canceled my current subscription to see if I could use the annual option there.

Could you please assist with updating my account from monthly to annual using this code?

Thank you!"

Similarly when it says rest day but also lists a workout….am I supposed to choose a rest day or the workout? And I guess I am basing it off the fatigue recomendations?

Imho these things should be explained in the app or in the program a bit better.

Issue with my account’s subscription,"Dear TrainingPeaks Support,

I am writing to bring your attention to an issue with my account’s subscription.

On September 11th, I renewed my annual Premium plan using credit card directly through your website. I received the payment confirmation; however, my profile has not updated to reflect the Premium status and is still showing as on the Free plan.

Previously, my annual subscription was managed through the Apple Store, but this time, after the subscription expired, I renewed it directly through the TrainingPeaks website.

I have attached the confirmation of my subscription for your reference. Could you please assist in resolving this issue and updating my account to Premium status?

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your prompt assistance.

Best regards,

I am kindly asking for confirmation that my subscription will not automatically renew.
Maybe you could also think about a change to the subscription page? Or sending out a confirmation-mail for the successful cancellation of the automatic renewal?
Thank you for your help and for building an awesome service!

I can’t link my training peaks account with my ELEMNT app,"I use Wahoo Elemnt Roam for my training sessions since about one year ago. At the beginning it was working perfectly, linked Training Peaks and Wahoo Elemnt companion app, but since a few weeks ago, my rides haven’t being synced from Elemnt app, I have uploaded it from ROUVY app, but when I ride on road, I can’t upload my training session… I already tried different options like removing and giving permissions again, but anything have worked. And there is something that called my attention, when I’m trying to sync both apps, following all the instructions from TrainingPeaks web, first going to my profile in Wahoo Elemnt app, then looking for TrainingPeaks in authorized apps section, and it’s in this moment when it send me to a landing page from TrainingPeaks that says “ Wahoo Fitness is requesting permission to access your account”, when clearly says at TrainingPeaks steps for syncing apps, “ make sure you are using the ELEMNT Companion app, and not the Wahoo Fitness or Utility apps”.
On the other hand, actually I’m able to see my training plan from TrainingPeaks in my computer, only if I authorize and have downloaded Wahoo Fitness app, otherwise I can’t see it.
It is importante to say that this is something that have being happening for more than 3 weeks…
I hope to have good news from you ASAP.
Thank you.

Analizar entrenamientos,"Buenos días Toni,
Tengo un problema con alguno de mis atletas y me gustaría que me resolvieran las dudas, si es posible. Hay algunos entrenamiento que aún que el atleta los haya realizado, a mi en el dashboard de TP me sale en rojo. El atleta dice que él tiene su dispositivo vinculado, ya que puede ver los entrenamientos que le planeo. Pero luego este entrenamiento no se sube a TP. Además, cuando sí que se suben, TP no me deja analizar las distintas métricas de este. Me gustaría saber porque sucede esto y si se puede solucionar. 

Muchas gracias,

Run seems to be Threshold pace in seconds / actual pace in seconds. When I do these (FTP and Pace) IF calculations  they basically match the calculated values in TP. However, when I do the same calculation for HR (actual average HR / Threshold HR) my IF values are much higher than the calculated value by TP. Essentially an athlete the does the same % of threshold for either pace or  FTP as their % of Threshold of HR the TSS based on pace or FTP will be higher. Is this a bug or is there reasoning behind this discrepency?

Hi there!



I bought the Mountaineering Intermediate/Advanced Mountain Fitness training plan and started a few days ago. I set my AeT by following instructions online at 142bpm. 



According to the video for setting zones, I thought the top of Z2 should be 142, and therefore my exercise yesterday should have been in the range of 128-142.



Instead, the guidance from TrainingPeaks was to stay between 114- 128 bpm. Today I'm supposed to do a recovery run at 92-114 bpm which seems really low. Is this correct?



I've attached the pictures of my zones and the workout guidance from yesterday.



Thanks!

Luke, I hate to bother you again but I'm having a problem with some of the workouts ending way too soon. It happened to me last week on a 35 minute endurance run that ended after 15 minutes. This morning it happened on my Fartlek run. After the 5th of my 6 intervals, I went from recovery to 6th interval to recovery to cooldown in a span of maybe 10-15 seconds. I'm wondering if this is an 80/20 issue or a TP issue.

Hey Ben,


Thank you for all the information. It is important to remember that the pace and HR numbers will not line up perfectly and as you can tell there can be so many other variables, the temperature, hills, how recovered you are, etc... It is good to take these numbers with a grain of salt. Give yourself some bigger zones if you terrain can vary a lot. For example, my plan that I follow is a pace plan, however I'm always checking my HR as well. I know my HR during easy runs should be in the 140s and my pace should be in the 9 minutes. So I give myself a good range, because I'm going to feel different everyday. I've also found that I really enjoy watching my HR on easy runs, but find it much easier to hit my paces on harder runs, it can be very hard to track HR on the speed days, because often times our HR is delayed on our watches. I hope this all helps, the goal of these plans is help you learn your zones and be able to make good judgement on each day to hit those workouts. After awhile you will know if you are running easy or if you pushed yourself in a speed workout.


Thank you.


Luke

Luke, having used 80/20 for a month or so, I really like it. There's one problem, though. Setting my zones has been very difficult. The talk test for heart rate  is so subjective. I've ranged from a threshold from 129 to 158. It seems to vary pretty wildly based on weather and how I'm feeling that day (lack of sleep, fatigue from previous runs, etc.). 158 is too fast. 129-133 is way too slow. In zone 1 at a 133 threshold, I'm at about a walking pace, or a little less. It's very difficult not to exceed the max, and it stresses my Achilles tendons to go that slow.  I finally settled in at 144, which seems perfect if I'm shooting for an RPE of about 3 in Zone 2. But on higher zones - in progression runs, for instance - there's no way I could run at SSP for 2 hrs., much less LTP at 1 hr. and CV at 30 min. I can run at those paces, but not for that long. Not even close, really. 

Additionally, I'd rather train by pace. Heart rate doesn't account for hills and I'm in a very hilly area so I typically have to slow to a crawl uphill to stay in a given zone. I switched to pace for this morning's run, but entering my last 5K time (26:54) gave me a pace that is significantly higher than I run in Zone 2 with a 144 heart rate threshold. In fact, on this morning's endurance run (5 min Zone followed by 35 minutes Zone 2) my heart rate was hovering between 138-144 for most of the run. I could probably run that pace for an hour or so, but not comfortably. It's certainly not a conversational pace. 

I'm wondering why there's such a large gap between the two. Like I said, training by heart rate at a threshold of 144 feels more ""right"" to me, except in the higher zones (above Zone 2). If I were to continue training by pace I wouldn't really be doing 80% of my training at low intensity. And I'd expect to get injured eventually. Running without injury or soreness is the primary reason for my interest in 80/20 training. 

I will go back training based on threshold heart rate if I don't have a choice. 144 seems to be my sweet spot for the lower zones. But I don't know how to handle those higher zones. And It kind of drives me crazy to always be exceeding the maximum on hills (or falling below it going downhill). I imagine I should just suck it up and try to keep my pace steady even if I exceed the zone parameters in those circumstances. But I really don't know for certain so I'd appreciate some clarity, as I intend to start training for a 5K in a couple weeks. 

Thanks

Ben

Thanks Luke, they did help me get re-synced. Hoping this won't be an ongoing issue. 

I'm enjoying the program I'm on now but it's probably a little too easy for me. I think I want to start a 12 week level 1 maintenance program. Then when I start training for a 5K in late August I can buy a Level 1 5K plan. Should I just buy via TP? Will I be able to set my start date/days off?

I will definitely consider a subscription if everything goes smoothly with the app and syncing but for now I'm going to go a la carte.

I am experiencing a couple problems with syncing. My workouts were syncing fine to TP the first couple days, then stopped. All my workouts from the past week are checked on the TP app under ""Apple Watch and Health"" so I'm not sure what went wrong. I didn't change any settings. My workout today didn't even load onto my Apple Watch. I'm hoping I've solved the problem by disconnecting and reconnecting TP with my Workout app, which I just did. But if you have any tips, please pass them on. 

Also, if my talk test heart rate should change in the middle of a training program, am I able to change that in TP, and will everything else adjust automatically? I tried it the other day under settings: zones: heart rate and I noticed that none of the other values (max heart rate, resting, and zones) didn't change when I changed the threshold heart rate. And FWIW, I don't recall ever having entered a max or resting heart rate. I assumed it was set automatically based on the threshold rate I entered. 

I really like this training. When the syncing works, it's exactly what I was hoping it would be. But TP seems a bit buggy sometimes. I'm hoping I can work around that because I'd like to continue using 80/20. 

Thanks for your patience.

I think the zone is set up.

I just need to know how to proceed when I do the actual workout.

Hey Benjamin,


I'm not seeing you in our system as a subscriber, did you purchase a stand alone training plan. I'm happy to help you get it all set up and connected with your apple watch. It sounds like we need to get your zone set up in Training Peaks, so your training plan plan will pull the correct HR zones for each workout onto your watch. You do not need to memorize your zone/times before your run.


Thank you.


Luke

How can we help you?: I have no idea how to use Training Peaks to train. I can't find anything in your help section or forums. I have my Apple Watch connected. I have my heart rate info entered on TP. Am I meant to memorize the zones/times and intensity? Because that's the only thing I can figure. But that's absurd."

I try to sync everything into TP in order to provide my coach with a best possible overview. 

In my gym, they now have treadmills with Apple Watch sign and you can connect watch with treadmill. This finally provides accurate distances. Apple health uses the distance provided by the treadmill as the devices exchange data. 

However, TP shows a different distance result in total compared to health app on my apple watch. Strave shows the accurate distance. For example: 24km in Apple health, compared to 22km in TP. I guess the 22km is the result the apple watch ""measures in background"" using its own algorithm, because before having the opporunity to connect treadmill with apple watch, the apple watch distance was always lagging behind.

I have my zones set properly and have been using the workout builder to make the workout that then goes to my Garmin. For some reason, ""Zone 1"" never matches what I put in. During warm-up and cooldown, it shifts my zone from 130-147 to 127-145. During recovery intervals, it shifts it to 136-154.

I have attached a screenshot of my workout, please note how the summary of workout details is different to what has been put into the editor. 

The only fix I have found to this is that I need to go back into the workout editor after I've built the workout to change all the Zone 1's to Zone 2's then back. It's becoming a fairly tedious exercise.

Dear Tony, 


I have a question or can I ask for a favor?!

Clemens Hesse from the German Cycling  National Federation (BDR) requested to put me in the coach list.
This is now two weeks ago.
I´m still waiting for that. At the moment it´s hard to work without that.

Can you speed up the process somehow?

Wahoo x trainingpeaks problem,"Dear Trainingpeaks,

I am facing a problem when trying to upload my workouts from my wahoo fitness app to my trainingpeaks. 
I cannot connect TP to my Wahoo account anymore. How can this be solved? I tried to contact wahoo, but they do not have a solution for me. I also tried to reset my settings of the Wahoo and the app, but nothing seems to work. 

I hope to hear from you soon,

However, I had some things pop up over the past few weeks so was not able to start the program and the event is in 13 weeks (on Decembver 8). So I see there is a similar 12 week program available and would like to switch to that. Please let me know what else you may need to assist.
Thank you,

Mobile app regression: loses typed in information when switching apps,"A few updates ago the Training Peaks mobile app on iOS started losing information.
Steps:
1. Open Training Peaks on iOS
2. Tap on notifications in the top right corner
3. Tap on a new activity
4. Enter a comment on the activity but DO NOT tap the paper airplane icon to submit
5. Switch apps, e.g. to Strava to look something up
6. Switch apps back to Training Peaks
7. Training Peaks now shows you your app home page, not the activity you had open, and everything you typed into the comment field is lost

Expected behavior:
7. Training Peaks to show you exactly the screen you were at before you switched apps, with all of your typed in content still intact in the comment field, with the cursor in the same place you left it.

This used to work, and broke a few updates ago and is very annoying because I have many times typed in a comment, switched to another app to get more info or read a text message etc. then when I switch back to Training Peaks it has completely lost my comment-in-progress and I have to type it all over again.

Another way of triggering this bug is:
5. Lock your phone
6. Unlock your phone
7. Training Peaks now shows you your app home page, and everything you typed into the comment field is lost

Separately:
* Can we have the ability to edit comments?
* Can we have the ability to select the text of comments we entered to copy out and re-use in another place like our Strava activities?"

Request #802600,"I have been collaborating with TP for many years. Training Peaks is in our jerseys, for about 15 years. Dirk Friel supported our team with complementary accounts for our young riders, and I helped Gear Fisher to make the first translations of TP to Spanish. I only mention this because I find a notable decay in the customer service and would hate to see TP go down like Finale did.

I was helped by a representative, and I should say that it was always cordial, but notably inefficient and the process gave me the sensation of an unknowledgeable worker following a help guide, bot-like treatment. Not only did the matter never get resolved, but the communication ended only because I asked for a new customer service representative, after several days of going in circles.

I only need to be able to erase a device from WKO5 and be able to sync an Edge 540. The representative didn't even know if the Garmin 540 is compatible with WKO5 and asked me to investigate with Garmin. If this is the new standard of ""help"" I frankly wont ever be inclined to ask for it again.

This is the last email I will write to customer service.

Training Plan Workout Schedule Issue,"Hello,

I've recently created a training plan for a group of students that I'm going to be working with and I'm having a little bit of an issue. 

Initially, I did not have it set up as a dynamic plan and then I noticed that the workouts I created using the new strength builder did not show up. Then I switched it to a dynamic plan and now the workouts using the new strength builder are showing up but the workouts I set using the walk or run builder are not showing up for the first 5 weeks.

It's a 12-week program, with run and/or walk workouts on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but those run/walk workouts are not showing up for the first 5 weeks. Those days are completely blank and then starting week 6 they show up. I also have a bike workout on Fridays that does the same thing. 

I assume I'm doing something wrong or they wouldn't be showing up on the later dates but I can't figure it out. 

The email address I'm using as a coach profile is patrick@syracusefitnesscenter.com.

Thank you very much

Hola Tony,

 

Ya me he suscrito y poco a poco voy manejándolo mejor. Te adjunto la licencia de atletismo de la federación española como muestra de ser entrenadora. He sido atleta profesional varios años e incluso he estudiado en UTEP un semestre, compitiendo en la NCAA de XC.

 

Ya me dices cómo hacemos con el pago y el descuento, de momento no me han cobrado nada, espero haberlo hecho bien.

 

Un saludo,

Alba

Hola Tony,

 

Te escribo para comentarte que me está gustando mucho la web. Tengo todavía muchas dudas, como es lógico, pero poco a poco voy viendo que puedo sacarle mucho partido. Mis atletas también están disfrutando con ella, así que ahora mismo te diría que vamos a seguir, a ver si nos decidimos.

 

¿Podría aumentar unos días el periodo de prueba gratuito? Considero que 7 días es poco para probar todo lo que me gustaría.

 

Muchas gracias,

Alba

No entanto, conforme consta na fatura em anexo, foi feita uma cobrança indevida de $23,71 referente ao plano Coach Edition Unlimited.

Gostaria de reiterar que tenho apenas dois alunos, e por isso, não há necessidade de um plano Unlimited.

Peço gentilmente que efetuem o reembolso do valor cobrado indevidamente e ajustem a cobrança para o valor correto de $19,00.

Agradeço a atenção e aguardo uma solução rápida para este problema.


Hello, TrainingPeaks Team,

I am once again experiencing issues with the billing on my account. I am subscribed to the Coach Edition, Limited Basics plan, which costs $19.00 per month. However, as detailed in the attached invoice, I was incorrectly charged $23.71 for the Coach Edition Unlimited plan.

I would like to emphasize that I only have two athletes, so an Unlimited plan is not necessary for me.

Please kindly issue a refund for the incorrect charge and adjust the billing to reflect the correct amount of $19.00.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to a prompt resolution.

Level 1 accreditation ,"Dear Team, 
I have been working with Training Peaks for a number of years and alongside this I offer specialist Sport Psychology and Counselling support. I am keen to gain Level 1 (and Level 2 accreditation) and wonder if there is any way of achieving direct entry to Level 1 by way of proof of education (ie, MSc Psychology of Sport) and by evidencing that I have held my Training Peaks account for well over the 3 months use required? For example, providing professional references etc. As a loyal customer I hope that you can see my commitment to using Training Peaks and can see the value in considering my request.

Tengo dos bicicletas, una con potenciómetro y otra sin potenciómetro. Cuando uso la bicicleta sin potenciómetro es necesario que la carga de entrenamiento se calcule en base a hrTSS no en base a TSS. Debo cambiar manualmente de TSS a hrTSS en cada actividad que hago con la bicicleta sin potenciómetro. Ahora todas mis actividades aparecen calculadas en TSS independientemente si uso o no potenciómetro, antes era automático.
Por favor, su soporte,

Card details updated,"Hi there, 
I hope you're having a great week. My payment for September hasn't gone through I'm afraid. I've checked card details and funds and there shouldn't be an issue. I've tried to re-enter the card details again but it won't allow me. If you can see if you can take payment again that would be great. If it still doesn't go through I can add another card and then switch back to the original (by adding, changing default, then re-adding the original) if that makes sense! 
My apologies for the inconvenience. 
Best wishes and have a great day.

Workouts not pairing,"Hello, I seem to have recurrent issues with workouts not pairing even though I change the type of workout to what is recommended by my coach, ie to the kettlebell for cross training. Then I go to the computer and it will still not pair when I try the pairing system overlay. What needs to happen to get the workouts to pair automatically and why doesn’t it pair when I ask it to?

Sorry, I was trying to start from scratch after a sync error imported some dupes - but I regret losing my long history as now I'm really struggling to get more than 90 days synced into the new account (rob@mukuru.com) that I've set up.

Is there any way you can restore my old account, it's still under paid period (only paid two days ago) - or possibly migrate my old data to my new account? 

Anything before July 3rd 2024.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Program inquiry,"Good morning,

I am a training enthusiast, and I am trying to get in shape and remain healthy. The only form of training I currently do is indoor rowing using Peloton rower and some strength training. I am starting to do some hikes 2-3 times a month.

I was wondering if Training Peaks would be useful for me. I see it being advertised for athletes who engage in different activities, but I don't see it being advertised for beginner athletes or enthusiasts like me.

I would appreciate if you could provide more information in this matter.

Questions strength 2,"Hi, 
We have some questions about the new strenght builder :-)
1. when we plan a workout for our clients but they want to do it the day after, the cannot move it, unless they 'upgrade'. With running workouts, it is possible, so is it a possibility to add this to strength workouts as well. It is not very handy like this
2. could you add a paramter 'rest between sets'? that would come in very handy for us :-)
3. sometimes we want to give a different number of reps on the left side than on the right side: could this also be a parameter?
4. another desired parameter is durantion/side

Thank you!!!!!!

(we are very happy with the new option, we use it a lot, that's why we have those requests - number 1. is the most important though).

I was delighted to receive the notification today regarding the new feature, Fueling Insights Beta, which has greatly piqued my interest.

I personally conduct similar assessments for my athletes, who regularly use the TrainingPeaks app. If there is an opportunity, I would be more than happy to join the project and provide accurate, validated data, including a detailed breakdown of CH/Fat ratios alongside the athletes' uploaded data.

I work with Cortex MetaLyzer 3B and MetaMax 3B devices, both in a private medical practice and at a sports club.

I'm really liking trainingpeaks as a schedule builder, however the issue I have is working out on Zwift. Alot of my training is indoor and using zwift just makes that more enjoyable. What i'm having trouble with is planning those rides and ticking them off. Is there a way I can plan a zwift ride so when completed, it's ticked off. At the moment the only option I can see is to either build the ride in TrainingPeaks (i.e. create a copy) and then complete that. Or, download the ride AFTER into trainingpeaks, which sure, shows I've completed the workout, but doesn't allow me to plan for the next ride. "

Late uploads,"Hi! 
I'm doing a 6 day stage race and I've had problems uploading my files on the same day of the stage itself - resulting in the session not being uploaded on the same day as I did it and hence affecting my CTL/ATL/TSB numbers to being inaccurate. 
I was able to upload the files days after they were recorded. But I think my CTL/ATL/TSB is still inaccurate because it should be a higher CTL and ATL and the TSB should be a negative number at this point. 

I'm writing this message to you in the morning of stage 5. 

What can I do? I'm guessing a bulk recalculation is not what I need, because my FTP is correct.

Also, in TP, the laps all came in correctly and they add up to 2700. I know I can manually change the distance, but of course that doesn't correct the sTSS.

I was previously associated with Total Tri Training (TTT) as an affiliated coach, under which agreement TTT had access to view and amend my athletes and training plans within Training Peaks.  
I separated from TTT over a year ago and I have been independent since.  I have 2 athletes (Lisa Stubbs and Scott Weatherhead) who joined me prior to the split with Total Tri Training, and they are still having training sessions dropped into their plans by TTT.  I have tried on multiple occasions to remove all shared access from my athletes, but it is a recurrent issue.  TTT does not seem to have access to athletes who have joined me since being independent.

I therefore require your urgent help to remove all third party access from all my accounts and athletes accounts.  Or please give me instructions on how to do this effectively myself.

Merci pour ton achat!
si tu me demandes de t accompagner et de te suivre dans TP en étant ton coach je suis à 125 euros par mois, mais c est une tres bonne idée  ;)  ;) ( pour info , de mon coté accepter un client dans Tp me coute 10$/mois).

Je fais spécialement des plans sur mesure par rapport à tes problématiques de travail, famille, voyages, niveaux sportif, course spécifique, enchaînements de courses…, C’est vraiment de l’accompagnement, de l’aide, du conseil sur le matériel, le choix de course, nutrition …etc.
Généralement j' ai des rdv téléphonique toutes les 2 semaines selon les besoins (généralement le lundi), je réponds sous 24 h aux messages whatsapp ou par mail. C’est vraiment une construction d’objectif.
Dans l'attente de ton retour, on pourrait se caler un call/visio un de ces jours.

Refund but disabled account,"I paid for a premium account, then asked for a refund as Premium comes free with a CTS Coach. I believe I have been issued the refund but the CTS coach is unable to switch my account to the premium version -- her email reads -- Hi Ben,

Normally that's something that I can do, but it's not allowing me to do it for your account (it says you'll be transitioned to a coach paid subscription on 9/26). Can you please respond to Training Peaks and let them know that I'm unable to ""manage"" your subscription and as them if they can permit me or assign you to a premium account charged to CTS?

Training Peaks calendar doesn't sync workouts with...,"Training Peaks calendar doesn't sync workouts with the Garmin calendar.
Hello.

I would appreciate some help because soo far I have spent around 3-4 hours solving this problem with no luck.

The Training Peaks calendar doesn't sync with my Garmin calendar. I receive all of my daily health matrices from Garmin on my TP calendar, but nothing the other way around.

Garmin and TP are connected and have all permissions from both sides. On my mobile app, TP still wants me to add a device for workouts, but when I add one, it says it's already connected to Garmin.

So the method I tried so far:

-disconnected and reconnected Garmin and TP via web app and mobile app. 5 times at least.

-syncing via Garmin Express (directly through cable)

-disconnecting and re-connecting my watch (Epix gen2 pro)

-restarting my phone and my watch

uploading TP calendar to Outlook calendar and then syncing with Garmin calendar via Office 365 account.

manually adding workouts in TP and Garmin calendar and then sending them to my device hoping that would trigger something but it didn't.

Sync issues,"Hello,
I have red áll the FAQ and written help on the website, but its still not working. I plan a workout on TP, but it doesnt send it to my garmin watch. Yes I have all the permittion enabled in both TP and Garmin Connect. It works the other way tho: when I do a workout it sends to TP, but my TP planned workouts doesnt show on Garmin Connect. Its very frustating. I have watched and red a lot of material on your website. My last hope is to disconnect Garmin Connect from my TP but you have written on the website that we should not do that. What else can i try?

Hey Mark, 

If you're wanting to do a search for EF on longer rides, I'd suggest using the advanced search option and then filter by sport type and duration.

Hope this helps - let me know if you have any other questions.

EF efficiency factor. I’m looking at my own data currently and would like to see how the efficiency has improved over the last few weeks as been ill. In one of the videos it showed the EF but I think it was typed in rather than a report. I’ll see if I can find the reference in the video and report back. 

Thanks again!

Enrico Trevisan Coach,"Buongiorno, scrivo in merito ad una curiosità

Ho utilizzato il vostro sistema come Coach e per fare delle prove ho creato l'utente Enrico3v.trevisan collegato ad una mail enricoxxx@icloud.com

tutto ok, collegato alla piattaforma Garmin mi ha importato tutti i dati. 

Ho visto poi che la piattaforma offre un _Client che dovrebbe essere lo stesso tra coach e atleta (stesso utente) 
ho provato a collegare il garmin ma non mi passa nessun dato o solo pochi. 

Dove sbaglio ?? 
In riassunto vorrei utilizzare la piattaforma per un futuro coach ma sperimentare per me stesso. Mi pare di aver capito che la piattaforma coach include un atleta premium, _client. 
corretto??

This morning I again cannot connect to my TP account from my iOS device. I first got a message that the App couldn't identify a server (something with TPAI (?) in the name (it flashed across my screen pretty fast).  Now when I try to login to my account on the App it says it cannot open an SSL socket and refuses to make the connection.

I guess the identity of your server, compared to the one on my phone, has changed and part of the SSL protocol is to identify the server it has been using to make sure my queries have not been redirected to a 3rd party server? I don't know how iOS stores server identities (if this happened on one of my other computers I would just delete the server ID and 'start over').

I attach the screen shot I am getting now when I try to connect from my iOS app.

On the weekend I also had trouble connecting from a Chrome browser on my computer. That seems to be working fine still this morning.

8020 Endurance Question,"Hey Training Peaks,


This is Luke with 8020 Endurance, I have a question about fitness, fatigue and form in the athletes view. Do we want to shoot for a positive number on form? Does that mean we are improving without overtraining? Would a negative form number suggest that we might have too much fatigue in our training?


Thank you.

Dear Uphill Athlete Team!

I purchased the Intro to Ultra trainingsplan last week and got billed twice via PayPal. There was a network error and when resubmitting the form the payment was done once more.

Please see attached both Purchase Order numbers: Both on the same Paypal account for the same item: P04273669 / P04273666.

Therefore I would like to ask if it is possible to get a refund of one payment?

Thank you for your support!

Abonnement,"Dear Training-Peaks,
I made a mistake: I didnt know that i accepted an Abonnement for more then 1 Year.
I had TrainingPeaks from last year September to this year September, because i wanted to do an Ironman and i did it in August 18th. But i didnt cancel the Abo, so now i had to pay 149€ again, but i dont have the Money for that and im not using TrainingPeaks at all. It would be very nice, if you could send me the Money back because i really dont use it and i didnt know that i accepted an Abonnement for more then 1 year. Please, it would be really nice if you could send me the Money back. 
I had a Wonderfoul year with Trainingpeaks and im sure that i am using it again later in my life because i definetely want to to a seoond and a third longdistance Triathlon but not at the Moment, i have to Focus on my University.

I am really sorry about that vut i am really sad as well because at the Moment i dont have the Money for that.

I love using Training Peaks and leading up to an event wan the premium. I've got a maintenance plan at the moment so am just on tickover. I bought the Premium yesterday mainly for the calendar sync and ability to move events around in advance. Problem is the calendar sync is so slow that it doesn't make it of any use, I'm better just making quick events at the start of the week in my own calendar and then I can pair them through the week. I'm sure it's an issue with how often you push the sync on your side, because I don't have this issue with any other calendar. 

With this in mind, it's really pointless for me paying for the premium, because it just doesn't work, so I'm look for a refund on the premium until I really need all the other functionality heading into my Ironman next summer. 

Thanks

All data exists in Garmin Connect, but only a smattering is getting sync'd into TP. Understand that not everything syncs, but it's bizarre that the amount that syncs is all over the place like this. what's the scoop?

leider bin ich erneut sehr enttäuscht vom BDR. Auf Ihren Plattformen werben sie damit, dass es eine Kooperation mit Trainingpeaks gibt und locken Mitglieder mit einem Rabatt.

Senden Sie mir bitte unbedingt noch heute diesen Code zu, oder nehmen Sie bitte diese Meldung von all Ihren Seiten, um nicht noch weitere Mitglieder zu verwirren.

monthly subscription,"Dear TrainingPeaks,
I am preparing for a competition on October 5 with TrainingPeaks. My original intention was to pay a monthly subscription after the one month trial period. I don't need the annual subscription as I don't use the app during the off-season.
Unfortunately, I was careless and forgot about the end of the trial period and the one year subscription fee was deducted. 
Is it possible to pay only one month's fee and get a refund for the amount that was charged? 
I would like to subscribe to the premium again next spring, but still with a monthly subscription.
Thank you in advance!

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Coach Team
<br>Thank you for your reply and I will look at the resources you have linked to.
<br>In a previous email you have said that the price would be discounted by 50% for schools, so $25 per month instead of $50.
<br>How do I access this price as when I try to upgrade I only get a choice of $19.99 or $49 per month.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Warm regards
<br>Brendan Miller

<p dir=""auto"">Hi there Coaching Team</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Any advice on coaching a high school cross country team? We have 9 weeks (starting Monday) to prepare for a 5 km run.
<br>I have experience of purchasing and using a plan by 80/20 as my preparation for a half marathon earlier this year. As for coming up with my own plan, I'm at a loss.
<br>Any guidance on what to read, who to follow etc would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Cheers
<br>Brendan

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Brendan,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thanks for reaching out! We definitely recognize the financial needs of local schools, so we do offer a special discount: 50% off the $49/month Unlimited coaching plan.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">What this means is that you can add as many Basic athletes as you would like to your coach account, and the cost would be $24.50 per month instead of $49. You are also not locked into any contract, so you can use your coach account for a few months out of the year and shut it down when needed. You can read more on our pricing HERE.&lt;<a href=""https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204072544-TrainingPeaks-Coach-Account-Pricing-and-Billing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204072544-TrainingPeaks-Coach-Account-Pricing-and-Billing</a>&gt;</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Additionally, you can create groups for your athletes and add training plans to their calendars.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">The first step we'd recommend taking is to start a free 7-day coach trial here: <a href=""https://www.trainingpeaks.com/become-a-coach/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.trainingpeaks.com/become-a-coach/</a></p>

7 Day Trial,"Hello,

I've been coaching using another platform for 15 years, but it's time for me to explore other options. I have a few people who use Training Peaks already and I can see their training by logging into their accounts, but it seems like most of my new clients are going to be more likely to want to use Training Peaks than the antiquated platform that I'm currently using. I may have had a 7 day trial before, but I don't think I actually took advantage of it. If I could get this set up again to kick things off that would be great. Let me know if this is possible.

Garmin Sync,"Hello,

I have a a Training Peaks plan that syncs with my Garmin watch. The workout syncs properly do my watch, and I am able to see the workout and start the workout from my watch. 

My issue is that when I finish the workout. it creates a new activity in Training Peaks, rather than upload the activity within the training peaks workout. See below. I did the Aerobiv Threshold Test, but it shows up in TP as a separate activity. Can you please advise."

Confusing subscription situation,"Hello,

This morning I was charged $24.99 for what I can only assume is a premium tier subscription. I assume this is the case because when I login to TrainingPeaks on the web, I see “Premium Edition” listed next to my account type. I don’t know how this subscription began because I’m not able to find a subscription confirmation in my email and I intentionally didn’t subscribe to the premium tier because I didn’t want the additional cost. I have purchased a couple training plans, but there was never any implication I was subscribing to anything.

All of that is to say, the $24.99 needs to be refunded immediately and my account should be downgraded.

Thanks

Best,
James

i have a couple issues to report as well as a feature request,"I am happy to submit multiple tickets if preferred.
1) I had to reload the operating system on my Windows machine. I am trying to reload WKO5 but I do not have the activation code I need.
2) Often (though not always) when using the TrainingPeaks mobile app when I leave a comment on a workout or add a workout to an athlete's schedule, the app crashes. When I go back to the account after killing the app, I do see that the changes I've made (either the comment added or workout added) have been processed.
3) In the TrainingPeaks desktop app (Windows 11), If a file is associated with the wrong workout, typically I go to the hamburger menu and choose unpair, then drag and drop the file into the correct workout. Lately, since the last interface change on the calendar, I've consistently noted that after unpairing the file from the workout, I am unable to drag the file into the correct (or any) workout, unless I open the file, interact with it, and save it again. I have attached a screen recording that demonstrates this.
4) Finally, a feature request. In the desktop app, when looking at someone's file, i would like to select a portion of the file and see more than just summary information. Specifically, I would love to be able to see time in zones or in specific bins, for the selected segment. The use case might be if someone does a warmup for a race, races, and does their cool down, all in one file. I would like to see time in zones for the race, independent of the warmup and cool down.
